IT BRISTLES WITH ERRORS  NOTERRORS OF FACT  BUT ERRORS OF INTERPRETATION  LOOKING BACK ACROSS THESEVEN CENTURIES THAT HAVE LAPSED SINCE AVIS EVERHARD COMPLETED HERMANUSCRIPT  EVENTS  AND THE BEARINGS OF EVENTS  THAT WERE CONFUSED ANDVEILED TO HER  ARE CLEAR TO US  SHE LACKED PERSPECTIVE  SHE WAS TOOCLOSE TO THE EVENTS SHE WRITES ABOUT  NAY  SHE WAS MERGED IN THE EVENTSSHE HAS DESCRIBED NEVERTHELESS  AS A PERSONAL DOCUMENT  THE EVERHARD MANUSCRIPT IS OFINESTIMABLE VALUE  BUT HERE AGAIN ENTER ERROR OF PERSPECTIVE  ANDVITIATION DUE TO THE BIAS OF LOVE  YET WE SMILE  INDEED  AND FORGIVEAVIS EVERHARD FOR THE HEROIC LINES UPON WHICH SHE MODELLED HER HUSBAND WE KNOW TO DAY THAT HE WAS NOT SO COLOSSAL  AND THAT HE LOOMED AMONG THEEVENTS OF HIS TIMES LESS LARGELY THAN THE MANUSCRIPT WOULD LEAD US TOBELIEVE WE KNOW THAT ERNEST EVERHARD WAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG MAN  BUT NOT SOEXCEPTIONAL AS HIS WIFE THOUGHT HIM TO BE  HE WAS  AFTER ALL  BUT ONE OFA LARGE NUMBER OF HEROES WHO  THROUGHOUT THE WORLD  DEVOTED THEIR LIVESTO THE REVOLUTION  THOUGH IT MUST BE CONCEDED THAT HE DID UNUSUALWORK  ESPECIALLY IN HIS ELABORATION AND INTERPRETATION OF WORKING CLASSPHILOSOPHY   PROLETARIAN SCIENCE  AND  PROLETARIAN PHILOSOPHY  WERE HISPHRASES FOR IT  AND THEREIN HE SHOWS THE PROVINCIALISM OF HIS MIND  ADEFECT  HOWEVER  THAT WAS DUE TO THE TIMES AND THAT NONE IN THAT DAYCOULD ESCAPE BUT TO RETURN TO THE MANUSCRIPT  ESPECIALLY VALUABLE IS IT INCOMMUNICATING TO US THE FEEL OF THOSE TERRIBLE TIMES  NOWHERE DO WE FINDMORE VIVIDLY PORTRAYED THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PERSONS THAT LIVED INTHAT TURBULENT PERIOD EMBRACED BETWEEN THE YEARS      AND       THEIRMISTAKES AND IGNORANCE  THEIR DOUBTS AND FEARS AND MISAPPREHENSIONS THEIR ETHICAL DELUSIONS  THEIR VIOLENT PASSIONS  THEIR INCONCEIVABLESORDIDNESS AND SELFISHNESS  THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE SO HARD FORUS OF THIS ENLIGHTENED AGE TO UNDERSTAND  HISTORY TELLS US THAT THESETHINGS WERE  AND BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY TELL US WHY THEY WERE  BUTHISTORY AND BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY DO NOT MAKE THESE THINGS ALIVE  WEACCEPT THEM AS FACTS  BUT WE ARE LEFT WITHOUT SYMPATHETIC COMPREHENSIONOF THEM THIS SYMPATHY COMES TO US  HOWEVER  AS WE PERUSE THE EVERHARDMANUSCRIPT  WE ENTER INTO THE MINDS OF THE ACTORS IN THAT LONG AGOWORLD DRAMA  AND FOR THE TIME BEING THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE OURMENTAL PROCESSES  NOT ALONE DO WE UNDERSTAND AVIS EVERHARD S LOVE FORHER HERO HUSBAND  BUT WE FEEL  AS HE FELT  IN THOSE FIRST DAYS  THEVAGUE AND TERRIBLE LOOM OF THE OLIGARCHY  THE IRON HEEL  WELL NAMED  WEFEEL DESCENDING UPON AND CRUSHING MANKIND AND IN PASSING WE NOTE THAT THAT HISTORIC PHRASE  THE IRON HEEL ORIGINATED IN ERNEST EVERHARD S MIND  THIS  WE MAY SAY  IS THE ONE MOOTQUESTION THAT THIS NEW FOUND DOCUMENT CLEARS UP  PREVIOUS TO THIS  THEEARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THE PHRASE OCCURRED IN THE PAMPHLET   YE SLAVES  WRITTEN BY GEORGE MILFORD AND PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER        THIS GEORGEMILFORD WAS AN OBSCURE AGITATOR ABOUT WHOM NOTHING IS KNOWN  SAVE THEONE ADDITIONAL BIT OF INFORMATION GAINED FROM THE MANUSCRIPT  WHICHMENTIONS THAT HE WAS SHOT IN THE CHICAGO COMMUNE  EVIDENTLY HE HADHEARD ERNEST EVERHARD MAKE USE OF THE PHRASE IN SOME PUBLIC SPEECH  MOSTPROBABLY WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN THE FALL OF       FROM THEMANUSCRIPT WE LEARN THAT EVERHARD USED THE PHRASE AT A PRIVATE DINNERIN THE SPRING OF       THIS IS  WITHOUT DISCUSSION  THE EARLIEST KNOWNOCCASION ON WHICH THE OLIGARCHY WAS SO DESIGNATED THE RISE OF THE OLIGARCHY WILL ALWAYS REMAIN A CAUSE OF SECRET WONDERTO THE HISTORIAN AND THE PHILOSOPHER  OTHER GREAT HISTORICAL EVENTSHAVE THEIR PLACE IN SOCIAL EVOLUTION  THEY WERE INEVITABLE  THEIR COMINGCOULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED WITH THE SAME CERTITUDE THAT ASTRONOMERSTO DAY PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE MOVEMENTS OF STARS  WITHOUT THESEOTHER GREAT HISTORICAL EVENTS  SOCIAL EVOLUTION COULD NOT HAVEPROCEEDED  PRIMITIVE COMMUNISM  CHATTEL SLAVERY  SERF SLAVERY  AND WAGESLAVERY WERE NECESSARY STEPPING STONES IN THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIETY BUT IT WERE RIDICULOUS TO ASSERT THAT THE IRON HEEL WAS A NECESSARYSTEPPING STONE  RATHER  TO DAY  IS IT ADJUDGED A STEP ASIDE  OR A STEPBACKWARD  TO THE SOCIAL TYRANNIES THAT MADE THE EARLY WORLD A HELL  BUTTHAT WERE AS NECESSARY AS THE IRON HEEL WAS UNNECESSARY BLACK AS FEUDALISM WAS  YET THE COMING OF IT WAS INEVITABLE  WHAT ELSETHAN FEUDALISM COULD HAVE FOLLOWED UPON THE BREAKDOWN OF THAT GREATCENTRALIZED GOVERNMENTAL MACHINE KNOWN AS THE ROMAN EMPIRE  NOTSO  HOWEVER  WITH THE IRON HEEL  IN THE ORDERLY PROCEDURE OF SOCIALEVOLUTION THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR IT  IT WAS NOT NECESSARY  AND IT WASNOT INEVITABLE  IT MUST ALWAYS REMAIN THE GREAT CURIOSITY OF HISTORY  AWHIM  A FANTASY  AN APPARITION  A THING UNEXPECTED AND UNDREAMED  ANDIT SHOULD SERVE AS A WARNING TO THOSE RASH POLITICAL THEORISTS OF TO DAYWHO SPEAK WITH CERTITUDE OF SOCIAL PROCESSES CAPITALISM WAS ADJUDGED BY THE SOCIOLOGISTS OF THE TIME TO BE THECULMINATION OF BOURGEOIS RULE  THE RIPENED FRUIT OF THE BOURGEOISREVOLUTION  AND WE OF TO DAY CAN BUT APPLAUD THAT JUDGMENT  FOLLOWINGUPON CAPITALISM  IT WAS HELD  EVEN BY SUCH INTELLECTUAL AND ANTAGONISTICGIANTS AS HERBERT SPENCER  THAT SOCIALISM WOULD COME  OUT OF THE DECAYOF SELF SEEKING CAPITALISM  IT WAS HELD  WOULD ARISE THAT FLOWER OF THEAGES  THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN  INSTEAD OF WHICH  APPALLING ALIKE TOUS WHO LOOK BACK AND TO THOSE THAT LIVED AT THE TIME  CAPITALISM ROTTEN RIPE  SENT FORTH THAT MONSTROUS OFFSHOOT  THE OLIGARCHY TOO LATE DID THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURYDIVINE THE COMING OF THE OLIGARCHY  EVEN AS IT WAS DIVINED  THEOLIGARCHY WAS THERE  A FACT ESTABLISHED IN BLOOD  A STUPENDOUS AND AWFULREALITY  NOR EVEN THEN  AS THE EVERHARD MANUSCRIPT WELL SHOWS  WAS ANYPERMANENCE ATTRIBUTED TO THE IRON HEEL  ITS OVERTHROW WAS A MATTER OFA FEW SHORT YEARS  WAS THE JUDGMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  IT IS TRUE THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEASANT REVOLT WAS UNPLANNED  AND THAT THE FIRSTREVOLT WAS PREMATURE  BUT THEY LITTLE REALIZED THAT THE SECOND REVOLT PLANNED AND MATURE  WAS DOOMED TO EQUAL FUTILITY AND MORE TERRIBLEPUNISHMENT IT IS APPARENT THAT AVIS EVERHARD COMPLETED THE MANUSCRIPT DURING THELAST DAYS OF PREPARATION FOR THE SECOND REVOLT  HENCE THE FACT THATTHERE IS NO MENTION OF THE DISASTROUS OUTCOME OF THE SECOND REVOLT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT SHE INTENDED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR IMMEDIATEPUBLICATION  AS SOON AS THE IRON HEEL WAS OVERTHROWN  SO THAT HERHUSBAND  SO RECENTLY DEAD  SHOULD RECEIVE FULL CREDIT FOR ALL THAT HEHAD VENTURED AND ACCOMPLISHED  THEN CAME THE FRIGHTFUL CRUSHING OF THESECOND REVOLT  AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT IN THE MOMENT OF DANGER  ERE SHEFLED OR WAS CAPTURED BY THE MERCENARIES  SHE HID THE MANUSCRIPT IN THEHOLLOW OAK AT WAKE ROBIN LODGE OF AVIS EVERHARD THERE IS NO FURTHER RECORD  UNDOUBTEDLY SHE WASEXECUTED BY THE MERCENARIES  AND  AS IS WELL KNOWN  NO RECORD OF SUCHEXECUTIONS WAS KEPT BY THE IRON HEEL  BUT LITTLE DID SHE REALIZE  EVENTHEN  AS SHE HID THE MANUSCRIPT AND PREPARED TO FLEE  HOW TERRIBLE HADBEEN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE SECOND REVOLT  LITTLE DID SHE REALIZE THATTHE TORTUOUS AND DISTORTED EVOLUTION OF THE NEXT THREE CENTURIES WOULDCOMPEL A THIRD REVOLT AND A FOURTH REVOLT  AND MANY REVOLTS  ALL DROWNEDIN SEAS OF BLOOD  ERE THE WORLD MOVEMENT OF LABOR SHOULD COME INTO ITSOWN  AND LITTLE DID SHE DREAM THAT FOR SEVEN LONG CENTURIES THE TRIBUTEOF HER LOVE TO ERNEST EVERHARD WOULD REPOSE UNDISTURBED IN THE HEART OFTHE ANCIENT OAK OF WAKE ROBIN LODGE ANTHONY MEREDITHARDIS NOVEMBER         B O M THE IRON HEELCHAPTER IMY EAGLETHE SOFT SUMMER WIND STIRS THE REDWOODS  AND WILD WATER RIPPLES SWEETCADENCES OVER ITS MOSSY STONES  THERE ARE BUTTERFLIES IN THE SUNSHINE AND FROM EVERYWHERE ARISES THE DROWSY HUM OF BEES  IT IS SO QUIET ANDPEACEFUL  AND I SIT HERE  AND PONDER  AND AM RESTLESS  IT IS THE QUIETTHAT MAKES ME RESTLESS  IT SEEMS UNREAL  ALL THE WORLD IS QUIET  BUT ITIS THE QUIET BEFORE THE STORM  I STRAIN MY EARS  AND ALL MY SENSES  FORSOME BETRAYAL OF THAT IMPENDING STORM  OH  THAT IT MAY NOT BE PREMATURE THAT IT MAY NOT BE PREMATURE         THE SECOND REVOLT WAS LARGELY THE WORK OF ERNEST EVERHARD      THOUGH HE COOPERATED  OF COURSE  WITH THE EUROPEAN LEADERS      THE CAPTURE AND SECRET EXECUTION OF EVERHARD WAS THE GREAT     EVENT OF THE SPRING OF      A D   YET SO THOROUGHLY HAD HE     PREPARED FOR THE REVOLT  THAT HIS FELLOW CONSPIRATORS WERE     ABLE  WITH LITTLE CONFUSION OR DELAY  TO CARRY OUT HIS     PLANS   IT WAS AFTER EVERHARD S EXECUTION THAT HIS WIFE WENT     TO WAKE ROBIN LODGE  A SMALL BUNGALOW IN THE SONOMA HILLS OF     CALIFORNIA SMALL WONDER THAT I AM RESTLESS  I THINK  AND THINK  AND I CANNOTCEASE FROM THINKING  I HAVE BEEN IN THE THICK OF LIFE SO LONG THAT IAM OPPRESSED BY THE PEACE AND QUIET  AND I CANNOT FORBEAR FROM DWELLINGUPON THAT MAD MAELSTROM OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION SO SOON TO BURST FORTH IN MY EARS ARE THE CRIES OF THE STRICKEN  AND I CAN SEE  AS I HAVESEEN IN THE PAST   ALL THE MARRING AND MANGLING OF THE SWEET  BEAUTIFULFLESH  AND THE SOULS TORN WITH VIOLENCE FROM PROUD BODIES AND HURLED TOGOD  THUS DO WE POOR HUMANS ATTAIN OUR ENDS  STRIVING THROUGH CARNAGEAND DESTRUCTION TO BRING LASTING PEACE AND HAPPINESS UPON THE EARTH        WITHOUT DOUBT SHE HERE REFERS TO THE CHICAGO COMMUNE AND THEN I AM LONELY  WHEN I DO NOT THINK OF WHAT IS TO COME  I THINK OFWHAT HAS BEEN AND IS NO MORE  MY EAGLE  BEATING WITH TIRELESS WINGS THEVOID  SOARING TOWARD WHAT WAS EVER HIS SUN  THE FLAMING IDEAL OF HUMANFREEDOM  I CANNOT SIT IDLY BY AND WAIT THE GREAT EVENT THAT IS HISMAKING  THOUGH HE IS NOT HERE TO SEE  HE DEVOTED ALL THE YEARS OF HISMANHOOD TO IT  AND FOR IT HE GAVE HIS LIFE  IT IS HIS HANDIWORK  HE MADEIT         WITH ALL RESPECT TO AVIS EVERHARD  IT MUST BE POINTED OUT     THAT EVERHARD WAS BUT ONE OF MANY ABLE LEADERS WHO PLANNED     THE SECOND REVOLT   AND WE TO DAY  LOOKING BACK ACROSS THE     CENTURIES  CAN SAFELY SAY THAT EVEN HAD HE LIVED  THE SECOND     REVOLT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LESS CALAMITOUS IN ITS OUTCOME     THAN IT WAS AND SO IT IS  IN THIS ANXIOUS TIME OF WAITING  THAT I SHALL WRITE OFMY HUSBAND  THERE IS MUCH LIGHT THAT I ALONE OF ALL PERSONS LIVING CANTHROW UPON HIS CHARACTER  AND SO NOBLE A CHARACTER CANNOT BE BLAZONEDFORTH TOO BRIGHTLY  HIS WAS A GREAT SOUL  AND  WHEN MY LOVE GROWSUNSELFISH  MY CHIEFEST REGRET IS THAT HE IS NOT HERE TO WITNESSTO MORROW S DAWN  WE CANNOT FAIL  HE HAS BUILT TOO STOUTLY AND TOOSURELY FOR THAT  WOE TO THE IRON HEEL  SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROMOFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY  WHEN THE WORD GOES FORTH  THE LABOR HOSTS OF ALLTHE WORLD SHALL RISE  THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE HISTORY OFTHE WORLD  THE SOLIDARITY OF LABOR IS ASSURED  AND FOR THE FIRST TIMEWILL THERE BE AN INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTION WIDE AS THE WORLD IS WIDE         THE SECOND REVOLT WAS TRULY INTERNATIONAL   IT WAS A     COLOSSAL PLAN  TOO COLOSSAL TO BE WROUGHT BY THE GENIUS OF     ONE MAN ALONE  LABOR  IN ALL THE OLIGARCHIES OF THE WORLD      WAS PREPARED TO RISE AT THE SIGNAL   GERMANY  ITALY  FRANCE      AND ALL AUSTRALASIA WERE LABOR COUNTRIES  SOCIALIST STATES      THEY WERE READY TO LEND AID TO THE REVOLUTION   GALLANTLY     THEY DID  AND IT WAS FOR THIS REASON  WHEN THE SECOND REVOLT     WAS CRUSHED  THAT THEY  TOO  WERE CRUSHED BY THE UNITED     OLIGARCHIES OF THE WORLD  THEIR SOCIALIST GOVERNMENTS BEING     REPLACED BY OLIGARCHICAL GOVERNMENTS YOU SEE  I AM FULL OF WHAT IS IMPENDING  I HAVE LIVED IT DAY AND NIGHTUTTERLY AND FOR SO LONG THAT IT IS EVER PRESENT IN MY MIND  FOR THATMATTER  I CANNOT THINK OF MY HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING OF IT  HE WAS THESOUL OF IT  AND HOW CAN I POSSIBLY SEPARATE THE TWO IN THOUGHT AS I HAVE SAID  THERE IS MUCH LIGHT THAT I ALONE CAN THROW UPON HISCHARACTER  IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT HE TOILED HARD FOR LIBERTY AND SUFFEREDSORE  HOW HARD HE TOILED AND HOW GREATLY HE SUFFERED  I WELL KNOW  FORI HAVE BEEN WITH HIM DURING THESE TWENTY ANXIOUS YEARS AND I KNOW HISPATIENCE  HIS UNTIRING EFFORT  HIS INFINITE DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE FORWHICH  ONLY TWO MONTHS GONE  HE LAID DOWN HIS LIFE I SHALL TRY TO WRITE SIMPLY AND TO TELL HERE HOW ERNEST EVERHARD ENTEREDMY LIFE  HOW I FIRST MET HIM  HOW HE GREW UNTIL I BECAME A PART OF HIM AND THE TREMENDOUS CHANGES HE WROUGHT IN MY LIFE  IN THIS WAY MAY YOULOOK AT HIM THROUGH MY EYES AND LEARN HIM AS I LEARNED HIM  IN ALL SAVETHE THINGS TOO SECRET AND SWEET FOR ME TO TELL IT WAS IN FEBRUARY        THAT I FIRST MET HIM  WHEN  AS A GUEST OF MYFATHER S  AT DINNER  HE CAME TO OUR HOUSE IN BERKELEY  I CANNOT SAY THATMY VERY FIRST IMPRESSION OF HIM WAS FAVORABLE  HE WAS ONE OF MANY ATDINNER  AND IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE WE GATHERED AND WAITED FOR ALLTO ARRIVE  HE MADE A RATHER INCONGRUOUS APPEARANCE  IT WAS  PREACHER SNIGHT   AS MY FATHER PRIVATELY CALLED IT  AND ERNEST WAS CERTAINLY OUTOF PLACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CHURCHMEN        JOHN CUNNINGHAM  AVIS EVERHARD S FATHER  WAS A PROFESSOR     AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY AT BERKELEY  CALIFORNIA   HIS CHOSEN     FIELD WAS PHYSICS  AND IN ADDITION HE DID MUCH ORIGINAL     RESEARCH AND WAS GREATLY DISTINGUISHED AS A SCIENTIST   HIS     CHIEF CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE WAS HIS STUDIES OF THE     ELECTRON AND HIS MONUMENTAL WORK ON THE  IDENTIFICATION OF     MATTER AND ENERGY   WHEREIN HE ESTABLISHED  BEYOND CAVIL AND     FOR ALL TIME  THAT THE ULTIMATE UNIT OF MATTER AND THE     ULTIMATE UNIT OF FORCE WERE IDENTICAL   THIS IDEA HAD BEEN     EARLIER ADVANCED  BUT NOT DEMONSTRATED  BY SIR OLIVER LODGE     AND OTHER STUDENTS IN THE NEW FIELD OF RADIO ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST PLACE  HIS CLOTHES DID NOT FIT HIM  HE WORE A READY MADESUIT OF DARK CLOTH THAT WAS ILL ADJUSTED TO HIS BODY  IN FACT  NOREADY MADE SUIT OF CLOTHES EVER COULD FIT HIS BODY  AND ON THIS NIGHT AS ALWAYS  THE CLOTH BULGED WITH HIS MUSCLES  WHILE THE COAT BETWEENTHE SHOULDERS  WHAT OF THE HEAVY SHOULDER DEVELOPMENT  WAS A MAZE OFWRINKLES  HIS NECK WAS THE NECK OF A PRIZE FIGHTER   THICK AND STRONG SO THIS WAS THE SOCIAL PHILOSOPHER AND EX HORSESHOER MY FATHER HADDISCOVERED  WAS MY THOUGHT  AND HE CERTAINLY LOOKED IT WITH THOSEBULGING MUSCLES AND THAT BULL THROAT  IMMEDIATELY I CLASSIFIED HIM  ASORT OF PRODIGY  I THOUGHT  A BLIND TOM   OF THE WORKING CLASS        IN THAT DAY IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF MEN TO COMPETE FOR PURSES     OF MONEY   THEY FOUGHT WITH THEIR HANDS   WHEN ONE WAS     BEATEN INTO INSENSIBILITY OR KILLED  THE SURVIVOR TOOK THE     MONEY         THIS OBSCURE REFERENCE APPLIES TO A BLIND NEGRO MUSICIAN     WHO TOOK THE WORLD BY STORM IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE     NINETEENTH CENTURY OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND THEN  WHEN HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME  HIS HANDSHAKE WAS FIRM ANDSTRONG  BUT HE LOOKED AT ME BOLDLY WITH HIS BLACK EYES  TOO BOLDLY  ITHOUGHT  YOU SEE  I WAS A CREATURE OF ENVIRONMENT  AND AT THAT TIME HADSTRONG CLASS INSTINCTS  SUCH BOLDNESS ON THE PART OF A MAN OF MY OWNCLASS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST UNFORGIVABLE  I KNOW THAT I COULD NOT AVOIDDROPPING MY EYES  AND I WAS QUITE RELIEVED WHEN I PASSED HIM ON ANDTURNED TO GREET BISHOP MOREHOUSE  A FAVORITE OF MINE  A SWEET ANDSERIOUS MAN OF MIDDLE AGE  CHRIST LIKE IN APPEARANCE AND GOODNESS  AND ASCHOLAR AS WELL BUT THIS BOLDNESS THAT I TOOK TO BE PRESUMPTION WAS A VITAL CLEW TO THENATURE OF ERNEST EVERHARD  HE WAS SIMPLE  DIRECT  AFRAID OF NOTHING  ANDHE REFUSED TO WASTE TIME ON CONVENTIONAL MANNERISMS   YOU PLEASED ME  HE EXPLAINED LONG AFTERWARD   AND WHY SHOULD I NOT FILL MY EYES WITHTHAT WHICH PLEASES ME   I HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF NOTHING  HEWAS A NATURAL ARISTOCRAT  AND THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS INTHE CAMP OF THE NON ARISTOCRATS  HE WAS A SUPERMAN  A BLOND BEASTSUCH AS NIETZSCHE  HAS DESCRIBED  AND IN ADDITION HE WAS AFLAME WITHDEMOCRACY        FRIEDERICH NIETZSCHE  THE MAD PHILOSOPHER OF THE     NINETEENTH CENTURY OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA  WHO CAUGHT WILD     GLIMPSES OF TRUTH  BUT WHO  BEFORE HE WAS DONE  REASONED     HIMSELF AROUND THE GREAT CIRCLE OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND OFF     INTO MADNESS IN THE INTEREST OF MEETING THE OTHER GUESTS  AND WHAT OF MY UNFAVORABLEIMPRESSION  I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE WORKING CLASS PHILOSOPHER  THOUGHONCE OR TWICE AT TABLE I NOTICED HIM  ESPECIALLY THE TWINKLE IN HIS EYEAS HE LISTENED TO THE TALK FIRST OF ONE MINISTER AND THEN OF ANOTHER  HEHAS HUMOR  I THOUGHT  AND I ALMOST FORGAVE HIM HIS CLOTHES  BUT THE TIMEWENT BY  AND THE DINNER WENT BY  AND HE NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK WHILE THE MINISTERS TALKED INTERMINABLY ABOUT THE WORKING CLASS AND ITSRELATION TO THE CHURCH  AND WHAT THE CHURCH HAD DONE AND WAS DOING FORIT  I NOTICED THAT MY FATHER WAS ANNOYED BECAUSE ERNEST DID NOT TALK ONCE FATHER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A LULL AND ASKED HIM TO SAY SOMETHING  BUTERNEST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WITH AN  I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY  WENTON EATING SALTED ALMONDS BUT FATHER WAS NOT TO BE DENIED  AFTER A WHILE HE SAID  WE HAVE WITH US A MEMBER OF THE WORKING CLASS  I AM SURE THAT HE CANPRESENT THINGS FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW THAT WILL BE INTERESTING ANDREFRESHING  I REFER TO MR  EVERHARD  THE OTHERS BETRAYED A WELL MANNERED INTEREST  AND URGED ERNEST FORA STATEMENT OF HIS VIEWS  THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM WAS SO BROADLYTOLERANT AND KINDLY THAT IT WAS REALLY PATRONIZING  AND I SAW THATERNEST NOTED IT AND WAS AMUSED  HE LOOKED SLOWLY ABOUT HIM  AND I SAWTHE GLINT OF LAUGHTER IN HIS EYES  I AM NOT VERSED IN THE COURTESIES OF ECCLESIASTICAL CONTROVERSY   HEBEGAN  AND THEN HESITATED WITH MODESTY AND INDECISION  GO ON   THEY URGED  AND DR  HAMMERFIELD SAID   WE DO NOT MIND THE TRUTHTHAT IS IN ANY MAN  IF IT IS SINCERE   HE AMENDED  THEN YOU SEPARATE SINCERITY FROM TRUTH   ERNEST LAUGHED QUICKLY DR  HAMMERFIELD GASPED  AND MANAGED TO ANSWER   THE BEST OF US MAY BEMISTAKEN  YOUNG MAN  THE BEST OF US  ERNEST S MANNER CHANGED ON THE INSTANT  HE BECAME ANOTHER MAN  ALL RIGHT  THEN   HE ANSWERED   AND LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT YOUARE ALL MISTAKEN  YOU KNOW NOTHING  AND WORSE THAN NOTHING  ABOUT THEWORKING CLASS  YOUR SOCIOLOGY IS AS VICIOUS AND WORTHLESS AS IS YOURMETHOD OF THINKING  IT WAS NOT SO MUCH WHAT HE SAID AS HOW HE SAID IT  I ROUSED AT THE FIRSTSOUND OF HIS VOICE  IT WAS AS BOLD AS HIS EYES  IT WAS A CLARION CALLTHAT THRILLED ME  AND THE WHOLE TABLE WAS AROUSED  SHAKEN ALIVE FROMMONOTONY AND DROWSINESS  WHAT IS SO DREADFULLY VICIOUS AND WORTHLESS IN OUR METHOD OF THINKING YOUNG MAN   DR  HAMMERFIELD DEMANDED  AND ALREADY THERE WAS SOMETHINGUNPLEASANT IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER OF UTTERANCE  YOU ARE METAPHYSICIANS  YOU CAN PROVE ANYTHING BY METAPHYSICS  ANDHAVING DONE SO  EVERY METAPHYSICIAN CAN PROVE EVERY OTHER METAPHYSICIANWRONG  TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION  YOU ARE ANARCHISTS IN THE REALM OFTHOUGHT  AND YOU ARE MAD COSMOS MAKERS  EACH OF YOU DWELLS IN A COSMOSOF HIS OWN MAKING  CREATED OUT OF HIS OWN FANCIES AND DESIRES  YOU DONOT KNOW THE REAL WORLD IN WHICH YOU LIVE  AND YOUR THINKING HAS NOPLACE IN THE REAL WORLD EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS PHENOMENA OF MENTALABERRATION  DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS REMINDED OF AS I SAT AT TABLE AND LISTENED TOYOU TALK AND TALK  YOU REMINDED ME FOR ALL THE WORLD OF THE SCHOLASTICSOF THE MIDDLE AGES WHO GRAVELY AND LEARNEDLY DEBATED THE ABSORBINGQUESTION OF HOW MANY ANGELS COULD DANCE ON THE POINT OF A NEEDLE WHY  MY DEAR SIRS  YOU ARE AS REMOTE FROM THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THETWENTIETH CENTURY AS AN INDIAN MEDICINE MAN MAKING INCANTATION IN THEPRIMEVAL FOREST TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO  AS ERNEST TALKED HE SEEMED IN A FINE PASSION  HIS FACE GLOWED  HISEYES SNAPPED AND FLASHED  AND HIS CHIN AND JAW WERE ELOQUENT WITHAGGRESSIVENESS  BUT IT WAS ONLY A WAY HE HAD  IT ALWAYS AROUSED PEOPLE HIS SMASHING  SLEDGE HAMMER MANNER OF ATTACK INVARIABLY MADE THEM FORGETTHEMSELVES  AND THEY WERE FORGETTING THEMSELVES NOW  BISHOP MOREHOUSEWAS LEANING FORWARD AND LISTENING INTENTLY  EXASPERATION AND ANGER WEREFLUSHING THE FACE OF DR  HAMMERFIELD  AND OTHERS WERE EXASPERATED  TOO AND SOME WERE SMILING IN AN AMUSED AND SUPERIOR WAY  AS FOR MYSELF  IFOUND IT MOST ENJOYABLE  I GLANCED AT FATHER  AND I WAS AFRAID HE WASGOING TO GIGGLE AT THE EFFECT OF THIS HUMAN BOMBSHELL HE HAD BEEN GUILTYOF LAUNCHING AMONGST US  YOUR TERMS ARE RATHER VAGUE   DR  HAMMERFIELD INTERRUPTED   JUSTPRECISELY WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU CALL US METAPHYSICIANS   I CALL YOU METAPHYSICIANS BECAUSE YOU REASON METAPHYSICALLY   ERNESTWENT ON   YOUR METHOD OF REASONING IS THE OPPOSITE TO THAT OF SCIENCE THERE IS NO VALIDITY TO YOUR CONCLUSIONS  YOU CAN PROVE EVERYTHING ANDNOTHING  AND NO TWO OF YOU CAN AGREE UPON ANYTHING  EACH OF YOU GOESINTO HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND THE UNIVERSE  ASWELL MAY YOU LIFT YOURSELVES BY YOUR OWN BOOTSTRAPS AS TO EXPLAINCONSCIOUSNESS BY CONSCIOUSNESS   I DO NOT UNDERSTAND   BISHOP MOREHOUSE SAID   IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALLTHINGS OF THE MIND ARE METAPHYSICAL  THAT MOST EXACT AND CONVINCINGOF ALL SCIENCES  MATHEMATICS  IS SHEERLY METAPHYSICAL  EACH AND EVERYTHOUGHT PROCESS OF THE SCIENTIFIC REASONER IS METAPHYSICAL  SURELY YOUWILL AGREE WITH ME   AS YOU SAY  YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND   ERNEST REPLIED   THE METAPHYSICIANREASONS DEDUCTIVELY OUT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTIVITY  THE SCIENTIST REASONSINDUCTIVELY FROM THE FACTS OF EXPERIENCE  THE METAPHYSICIAN REASONSFROM THEORY TO FACTS  THE SCIENTIST REASONS FROM FACTS TO THEORY  THEMETAPHYSICIAN EXPLAINS THE UNIVERSE BY HIMSELF  THE SCIENTIST EXPLAINSHIMSELF BY THE UNIVERSE   THANK GOD WE ARE NOT SCIENTISTS   DR  HAMMERFIELD MURMUREDCOMPLACENTLY  WHAT ARE YOU THEN   ERNEST DEMANDED  PHILOSOPHERS   THERE YOU GO   ERNEST LAUGHED   YOU HAVE LEFT THE REAL AND SOLID EARTHAND ARE UP IN THE AIR WITH A WORD FOR A FLYING MACHINE  PRAY COME DOWNTO EARTH AND TELL ME PRECISELY WHAT YOU DO MEAN BY PHILOSOPHY   PHILOSOPHY IS     DR  HAMMERFIELD PAUSED AND CLEARED HISTHROAT    SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE DEFINED COMPREHENSIVELY EXCEPT TOSUCH MINDS AND TEMPERAMENTS AS ARE PHILOSOPHICAL  THE NARROW SCIENTISTWITH HIS NOSE IN A TEST TUBE CANNOT UNDERSTAND PHILOSOPHY  ERNEST IGNORED THE THRUST  IT WAS ALWAYS HIS WAY TO TURN THE POINT BACKUPON AN OPPONENT  AND HE DID IT NOW  WITH A BEAMING BROTHERLINESS OFFACE AND UTTERANCE  THEN YOU WILL UNDOUBTEDLY UNDERSTAND THE DEFINITION I SHALL NOW MAKEOF PHILOSOPHY  BUT BEFORE I MAKE IT  I SHALL CHALLENGE YOU TO POINT OUTERROR IN IT OR TO REMAIN A SILENT METAPHYSICIAN  PHILOSOPHY IS MERELYTHE WIDEST SCIENCE OF ALL  ITS REASONING METHOD IS THE SAME AS THAT OFANY PARTICULAR SCIENCE AND OF ALL PARTICULAR SCIENCES  AND BY THATSAME METHOD OF REASONING  THE INDUCTIVE METHOD  PHILOSOPHY FUSES ALLPARTICULAR SCIENCES INTO ONE GREAT SCIENCE  AS SPENCER SAYS  THE DATAOF ANY PARTICULAR SCIENCE ARE PARTIALLY UNIFIED KNOWLEDGE  PHILOSOPHYUNIFIES THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IS CONTRIBUTED BY ALL THE SCIENCES PHILOSOPHY IS THE SCIENCE OF SCIENCE  THE MASTER SCIENCE  IF YOU PLEASE HOW DO YOU LIKE MY DEFINITION   VERY CREDITABLE  VERY CREDITABLE   DR  HAMMERFIELD MUTTERED LAMELY BUT ERNEST WAS MERCILESS  REMEMBER   HE WARNED   MY DEFINITION IS FATAL TO METAPHYSICS  IF YOU DONOT NOW POINT OUT A FLAW IN MY DEFINITION  YOU ARE DISQUALIFIED LATER ONFROM ADVANCING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS  YOU MUST GO THROUGH LIFE SEEKINGTHAT FLAW AND REMAINING METAPHYSICALLY SILENT UNTIL YOU HAVE FOUND IT  ERNEST WAITED  THE SILENCE WAS PAINFUL  DR  HAMMERFIELD WAS PAINED  HEWAS ALSO PUZZLED  ERNEST S SLEDGE HAMMER ATTACK DISCONCERTED HIM  HEWAS NOT USED TO THE SIMPLE AND DIRECT METHOD OF CONTROVERSY  HE LOOKEDAPPEALINGLY AROUND THE TABLE  BUT NO ONE ANSWERED FOR HIM  I CAUGHTFATHER GRINNING INTO HIS NAPKIN  THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF DISQUALIFYING THE METAPHYSICIANS   ERNEST SAID WHEN HE HAD RENDERED DR  HAMMERFIELD S DISCOMFITURE COMPLETE   JUDGETHEM BY THEIR WORKS  WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR MANKIND BEYOND THE SPINNINGOF AIRY FANCIES AND THE MISTAKING OF THEIR OWN SHADOWS FOR GODS  THEYHAVE ADDED TO THE GAYETY OF MANKIND  I GRANT  BUT WHAT TANGIBLE GOODHAVE THEY WROUGHT FOR MANKIND  THEY PHILOSOPHIZED  IF YOU WILL PARDON MYMISUSE OF THE WORD  ABOUT THE HEART AS THE SEAT OF THE EMOTIONS  WHILETHE SCIENTISTS WERE FORMULATING THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD  THEYDECLAIMED ABOUT FAMINE AND PESTILENCE AS BEING SCOURGES OF GOD  WHILETHE SCIENTISTS WERE BUILDING GRANARIES AND DRAINING CITIES  THEYBUILDED GODS IN THEIR OWN SHAPES AND OUT OF THEIR OWN DESIRES  WHILETHE SCIENTISTS WERE BUILDING ROADS AND BRIDGES  THEY WERE DESCRIBINGTHE EARTH AS THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE  WHILE THE SCIENTISTS WEREDISCOVERING AMERICA AND PROBING SPACE FOR THE STARS AND THE LAWS OFTHE STARS  IN SHORT  THE METAPHYSICIANS HAVE DONE NOTHING  ABSOLUTELYNOTHING  FOR MANKIND  STEP BY STEP  BEFORE THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE  THEYHAVE BEEN DRIVEN BACK  AS FAST AS THE ASCERTAINED FACTS OF SCIENCE HAVEOVERTHROWN THEIR SUBJECTIVE EXPLANATIONS OF THINGS  THEY HAVE MADE NEWSUBJECTIVE EXPLANATIONS OF THINGS  INCLUDING EXPLANATIONS OF THE LATESTASCERTAINED FACTS  AND THIS  I DOUBT NOT  THEY WILL GO ON DOING TOTHE END OF TIME  GENTLEMEN  A METAPHYSICIAN IS A MEDICINE MAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE ESKIMO WHO MAKES A FUR CLADBLUBBER EATING GOD IS MERELY A DIFFERENCE OF SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS OFASCERTAINED FACTS  THAT IS ALL   YET THE THOUGHT OF ARISTOTLE RULED EUROPE FOR TWELVE CENTURIES   DR BALLINGFORD ANNOUNCED POMPOUSLY   AND ARISTOTLE WAS A METAPHYSICIAN  DR  BALLINGFORD GLANCED AROUND THE TABLE AND WAS REWARDED BY NODS ANDSMILES OF APPROVAL  YOUR ILLUSTRATION IS MOST UNFORTUNATE   ERNEST REPLIED   YOU REFER TO AVERY DARK PERIOD IN HUMAN HISTORY  IN FACT  WE CALL THAT PERIOD THE DARKAGES  A PERIOD WHEREIN SCIENCE WAS RAPED BY THE METAPHYSICIANS  WHEREINPHYSICS BECAME A SEARCH FOR THE PHILOSOPHER S STONE  WHEREIN CHEMISTRYBECAME ALCHEMY  AND ASTRONOMY BECAME ASTROLOGY  SORRY THE DOMINATION OFARISTOTLE S THOUGHT  DR  BALLINGFORD LOOKED PAINED  THEN HE BRIGHTENED UP AND SAID  GRANTED THIS HORRIBLE PICTURE YOU HAVE DRAWN  YET YOU MUST CONFESS THATMETAPHYSICS WAS INHERENTLY POTENT IN SO FAR AS IT DREW HUMANITY OUTOF THIS DARK PERIOD AND ON INTO THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SUCCEEDINGCENTURIES   METAPHYSICS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT   ERNEST RETORTED  WHAT   DR  HAMMERFIELD CRIED   IT WAS NOT THE THINKING AND THESPECULATION THAT LED TO THE VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY   AH  MY DEAR SIR   ERNEST SMILED   I THOUGHT YOU WERE DISQUALIFIED  YOUHAVE NOT YET PICKED OUT THE FLAW IN MY DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY  YOU ARENOW ON AN UNSUBSTANTIAL BASIS  BUT IT IS THE

METAPHYSICS DID NOTWORK  YOU HAVE NO PROOF  YOUNG MAN  THEY HAVE ALWAYS WORKED   I TAKE IT AS PROOF THAT BERKELEY S METAPHYSICS DID NOT WORK  BECAUSE   ERNEST PAUSED CALMLY FOR A MOMENT   BECAUSE BERKELEY MADE AN INVARIABLEPRACTICE OF GOING THROUGH DOORS INSTEAD OF WALLS  BECAUSE HE TRUSTED HISLIFE TO SOLID BREAD AND BUTTER AND ROAST BEEF  BECAUSE HE SHAVED HIMSELFWITH A RAZOR THAT WORKED WHEN

HAMMERFIELD WAS TEMPORARILY CRUSHED  AND THE BATTLE RAGED ON INNEW DIRECTIONS  ON POINT AFTER POINT  ERNEST CHALLENGED THE MINISTERS WHEN THEY AFFIRMED THAT THEY KNEW THE WORKING CLASS  HE TOLD THEMFUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS ABOUT THE WORKING CLASS THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW  ANDCHALLENGED THEM FOR DISPROOFS  HE GAVE THEM FACTS  ALWAYS FACTS  CHECKEDTHEIR EXCURSIONS INTO THE AIR  AND BROUGHT THEM BACK

UNACCEPTABLE DOCTRINE   ESPECIALLY     WERE THEY CAST OUT WHEN THEIR PREACHING BECAME TAINTED WITH     SOCIALISM THIS TIME THERE WAS NO DISSENT  THEY SAT DUMBLY ACQUIESCENT  WITH THEEXCEPTION OF DR  HAMMERFIELD  WHO SAID  IT IS WHEN THEIR THINKING IS WRONG THAT THEY ARE ASKED TO RESIGN   WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING WHEN THEIR THINKING IS UNACCEPTABLE  ERNEST ANSWERED  AND THEN WENT ON   SO I

GAVEVENT TO ROARS OF GARGANTUAN LAUGHTER  NOT SINCE THE DEATH OF MY MOTHERHAD I KNOWN HIM TO LAUGH SO HEARTILY  I LL WAGER DR  HAMMERFIELD WAS NEVER UP AGAINST ANYTHING LIKE IT IN HISLIFE   HE LAUGHED    THE COURTESIES OF ECCLESIASTICAL CONTROVERSY   DIDYOU NOTICE HOW HE BEGAN LIKE A LAMB  EVERHARD  I MEAN  AND HOW QUICKLYHE BECAME A ROARING LION  HE HAS A SPLENDIDLY DISCIPLINED MIND  HE WOULDHAVE MADE A GOOD SCIENTIST IF HIS ENERGIES HAD BEEN DIRECTED THAT WAY  I NEED SCARCELY SAY THAT I WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN ERNEST EVERHARD  ITWAS NOT ALONE WHAT HE HAD SAID AND HOW HE HAD SAID IT  BUT IT WAS THEMAN HIMSELF  I HAD NEVER MET A MAN LIKE HIM  I SUPPOSE THAT WAS WHY  INSPITE OF MY TWENTY FOUR YEARS  I HAD NOT MARRIED  I LIKED HIM  I HAD TOCONFESS IT TO MYSELF  AND MY LIKE FOR HIM WAS FOUNDED ON THINGSBEYOND INTELLECT AND ARGUMENT  REGARDLESS OF HIS BULGING MUSCLES ANDPRIZE FIGHTER S THROAT  HE IMPRESSED ME AS AN INGENUOUS BOY  I FELTTHAT UNDER THE GUISE OF AN INTELLECTUAL SWASHBUCKLER WAS A DELICATE ANDSENSITIVE SPIRIT  I SENSED THIS  IN WAYS I KNEW NOT  SAVE THAT THEY WEREMY WOMAN S INTUITIONS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT CLARION CALL OF HIS THAT WENT TO MY HEART IT STILL RANG IN MY EARS  AND I FELT THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR ITAGAIN  AND TO SEE AGAIN THAT GLINT OF LAUGHTER IN HIS EYES THAT BELIEDTHE IMPASSIONED SERIOUSNESS OF HIS FACE  AND THERE WERE FURTHER REACHESOF VAGUE AND INDETERMINATE FEELINGS THAT STIRRED IN ME  I ALMOST LOVEDHIM THEN  THOUGH I AM CONFIDENT  HAD I NEVER SEEN HIM AGAIN  THAT THEVAGUE FEELINGS WOULD HAVE PASSED AWAY AND THAT I SHOULD EASILY HAVEFORGOTTEN HIM BUT I WAS NOT DESTINED NEVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN  MY FATHER S NEW BORNINTEREST IN SOCIOLOGY AND THE DINNER PARTIES HE GAVE WOULD NOT PERMIT FATHER WAS NOT A SOCIOLOGIST  HIS MARRIAGE WITH MY MOTHER HAD BEEN VERYHAPPY  AND IN THE RESEARCHES OF HIS OWN SCIENCE  PHYSICS  HE HAD BEENVERY HAPPY  BUT WHEN MOTHER DIED  HIS OWN WORK COULD NOT FILL THEEMPTINESS  AT FIRST  IN A MILD WAY  HE HAD DABBLED IN PHILOSOPHY  THEN BECOMING INTERESTED  HE HAD DRIFTED ON INTO ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY  HEHAD A STRONG SENSE OF JUSTICE  AND HE SOON BECAME FIRED WITH A PASSIONTO REDRESS WRONG  IT WAS WITH GRATITUDE THAT I HAILED THESE SIGNS OF ANEW INTEREST IN LIFE  THOUGH I LITTLE DREAMED WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULDBE  WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF A BOY HE PLUNGED EXCITEDLY INTO THESE NEWPURSUITS  REGARDLESS OF WHITHER THEY LED HIM HE HAD BEEN USED ALWAYS TO THE LABORATORY  AND SO IT WAS THAT HE TURNEDTHE DINING ROOM INTO A SOCIOLOGICAL LABORATORY  HERE CAME TO DINNERALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF MEN   SCIENTISTS  POLITICIANS  BANKERS MERCHANTS  PROFESSORS  LABOR LEADERS  SOCIALISTS  AND ANARCHISTS  HESTIRRED THEM TO DISCUSSION  AND ANALYZED THEIR THOUGHTS OF LIFE ANDSOCIETY HE HAD MET ERNEST SHORTLY PRIOR TO THE  PREACHER S NIGHT   AND AFTER THEGUESTS WERE GONE  I LEARNED HOW HE HAD MET HIM  PASSING DOWN A STREET ATNIGHT AND STOPPING TO LISTEN TO A MAN ON A SOAP BOX WHO WAS ADDRESSINGA CROWD OF WORKINGMEN  THE MAN ON THE BOX WAS ERNEST  NOT THAT HE WASA MERE SOAP BOX ORATOR  HE STOOD HIGH IN THE COUNCILS OF THE SOCIALISTPARTY  WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS  AND WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER IN THEPHILOSOPHY OF SOCIALISM  BUT HE HAD A CERTAIN CLEAR WAY OF STATING THEABSTRUSE IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE  WAS A BORN EXPOSITOR AND TEACHER  ANDWAS NOT ABOVE THE SOAP BOX AS A MEANS OF INTERPRETING ECONOMICS TO THEWORKINGMEN MY FATHER STOPPED TO LISTEN  BECAME INTERESTED  EFFECTED A MEETING  AND AFTER QUITE AN ACQUAINTANCE  INVITED HIM TO THE MINISTERS  DINNER  ITWAS AFTER THE DINNER THAT FATHER TOLD ME WHAT LITTLE HE KNEW ABOUT HIM HE HAD BEEN BORN IN THE WORKING CLASS  THOUGH HE WAS A DESCENDANT OFTHE OLD LINE OF EVERHARDS THAT FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS HAD LIVEDIN AMERICA   AT TEN YEARS OF AGE HE HAD GONE TO WORK IN THE MILLS AND LATER HE SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP AND BECAME A HORSESHOER  HE WASSELF EDUCATED  HAD TAUGHT HIMSELF GERMAN AND FRENCH  AND AT THAT TIMEWAS EARNING A MEAGRE LIVING BY TRANSLATING SCIENTIFIC AND PHILOSOPHICALWORKS FOR A STRUGGLING SOCIALIST PUBLISHING HOUSE IN CHICAGO  ALSO  HISEARNINGS WERE ADDED TO BY THE ROYALTIES FROM THE SMALL SALES OF HIS OWNECONOMIC AND PHILOSOPHIC WORKS        THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BEING NATIVE BORN AND FOREIGN BORN     WAS SHARP AND INVIDIOUS IN THOSE DAYS THIS MUCH I LEARNED OF HIM BEFORE I WENT TO BED  AND I LAY LONG AWAKE LISTENING IN MEMORY TO THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE  I GREW FRIGHTENED ATMY THOUGHTS  HE WAS SO UNLIKE THE MEN OF MY OWN CLASS  SO ALIEN AND SOSTRONG  HIS MASTERFULNESS DELIGHTED ME AND TERRIFIED ME  FOR MY FANCIESWANTONLY ROVED UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF CONSIDERING HIM AS A LOVER  AS AHUSBAND  I HAD ALWAYS HEARD THAT THE STRENGTH OF MEN WAS AN IRRESISTIBLEATTRACTION TO WOMEN  BUT HE WAS TOO STRONG   NO  NO   I CRIED OUT   ITIS IMPOSSIBLE  ABSURD   AND ON THE MORROW I AWOKE TO FIND IN MYSELFA LONGING TO SEE HIM AGAIN  I WANTED TO SEE HIM MASTERING MEN INDISCUSSION  THE WAR NOTE IN HIS VOICE  TO SEE HIM  IN ALL HIS CERTITUDEAND STRENGTH  SHATTERING THEIR COMPLACENCY  SHAKING THEM OUT OF THEIRRUTS OF THINKING  WHAT IF HE DID SWASHBUCKLE  TO USE HIS OWN PHRASE   ITWORKED   IT PRODUCED EFFECTS  AND  BESIDES  HIS SWASHBUCKLING WAS A FINETHING TO SEE  IT STIRRED ONE LIKE THE ONSET OF BATTLE SEVERAL DAYS PASSED DURING WHICH I READ ERNEST S BOOKS  BORROWED FROM MYFATHER  HIS WRITTEN WORD WAS AS HIS SPOKEN WORD  CLEAR AND CONVINCING IT WAS ITS ABSOLUTE SIMPLICITY THAT CONVINCED EVEN WHILE ONE CONTINUEDTO DOUBT  HE HAD THE GIFT OF LUCIDITY  HE WAS THE PERFECT EXPOSITOR YET  IN SPITE OF HIS STYLE  THERE WAS MUCH THAT I DID NOT LIKE  HE LAIDTOO GREAT STRESS ON WHAT HE CALLED THE CLASS STRUGGLE  THE ANTAGONISMBETWEEN LABOR AND CAPITAL  THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST FATHER REPORTED WITH GLEE DR  HAMMERFIELD S JUDGMENT OF ERNEST  WHICHWAS TO THE EFFECT THAT HE WAS  AN INSOLENT YOUNG PUPPY  MADE BUMPTIOUSBY A LITTLE AND VERY INADEQUATE LEARNING   ALSO  DR  HAMMERFIELDDECLINED TO MEET ERNEST AGAIN BUT BISHOP MOREHOUSE TURNED OUT TO HAVE BECOME INTERESTED IN ERNEST AND WAS ANXIOUS FOR ANOTHER MEETING   A STRONG YOUNG MAN   HE SAID   ANDVERY MUCH ALIVE  VERY MUCH ALIVE  BUT HE IS TOO SURE  TOO SURE  ERNEST CAME ONE AFTERNOON WITH FATHER  THE BISHOP HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AND WE WERE HAVING TEA ON THE VERANDA  ERNEST S CONTINUED PRESENCE INBERKELEY  BY THE WAY  WAS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FACT THAT HE WAS TAKINGSPECIAL COURSES IN BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY  AND ALSO THAT HE WAS HARDAT WORK ON A NEW BOOK ENTITLED  PHILOSOPHY AND REVOLUTION          THIS BOOK CONTINUED TO BE SECRETLY PRINTED THROUGHOUT THE     THREE CENTURIES OF THE IRON HEEL   THERE ARE SEVERAL COPIES     OF VARIOUS EDITIONS IN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF ARDIS THE VERANDA SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE BECOME SMALL WHEN ERNEST ARRIVED NOT THAT HE WAS SO VERY LARGE  HE STOOD ONLY FIVE FEET NINE INCHES  BUTTHAT HE SEEMED TO RADIATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF LARGENESS  AS HE STOPPED TOMEET ME  HE BETRAYED A CERTAIN SLIGHT AWKWARDNESS THAT WAS STRANGELY ATVARIANCE WITH HIS BOLD LOOKING EYES AND HIS FIRM  SURE HAND THAT CLASPEDFOR A MOMENT IN GREETING  AND IN THAT MOMENT HIS EYES WERE JUST ASSTEADY AND SURE  THERE SEEMED A QUESTION IN THEM THIS TIME  AND ASBEFORE HE LOOKED AT ME OVER LONG  I HAVE BEEN READING YOUR  WORKING CLASS PHILOSOPHY    I SAID  AND HISEYES LIGHTED IN A PLEASED WAY  OF COURSE   HE ANSWERED   YOU TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE AUDIENCE TOWHICH IT WAS ADDRESSED   I DID  AND IT IS BECAUSE I DID THAT I HAVE A QUARREL WITH YOU   ICHALLENGED  I  TOO  HAVE A QUARREL WITH YOU  MR  EVERHARD   BISHOP MOREHOUSE SAID ERNEST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHIMSICALLY AND ACCEPTED A CUP OF TEA THE BISHOP BOWED AND GAVE ME PRECEDENCE  YOU FOMENT CLASS HATRED   I SAID   I CONSIDER IT WRONG AND CRIMINALTO APPEAL TO ALL THAT IS NARROW AND BRUTAL IN THE WORKING CLASS  CLASSHATRED IS ANTI SOCIAL  AND  IT SEEMS TO ME  ANTI SOCIALISTIC   NOT GUILTY   HE ANSWERED   CLASS HATRED IS NEITHER IN THE TEXT NOR INTHE SPIRIT OF ANYTHING I HAVE EVERY WRITTEN   OH   I CRIED REPROACHFULLY  AND REACHED FOR HIS BOOK AND OPENED IT HE SIPPED HIS TEA AND SMILED AT ME WHILE I RAN OVER THE PAGES

AT HIM TRIUMPHANTLY  NO MENTION THERE OF CLASS HATRED   HE SMILED BACK  BUT   I ANSWERED   YOU SAY  CLASS STRUGGLE    A DIFFERENT THING FROM CLASS HATRED   HE REPLIED   AND  BELIEVE ME WE FOMENT NO HATRED  WE SAY THAT THE CLASS STRUGGLE IS A LAW OF SOCIALDEVELOPMENT  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IT  WE DO NOT MAKE THE CLASSSTRUGGLE  WE MERELY EXPLAIN IT  AS NEWTON EXPLAINED GRAVITATION  WEEXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT PRODUCES THE CLASSSTRUGGLE   BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST   I CRIED  I AGREE WITH YOU HEARTILY   HE ANSWERED   THAT IS WHAT WE SOCIALISTSARE TRYING TO BRING ABOUT   THE ABOLITION OF THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST PARDON ME  LET ME READ AN EXTRACT   HE TOOK HIS BOOK AND TURNED BACKSEVERAL PAGES   PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX   THE CYCLE OF CLASSSTRUGGLES WHICH BEGAN WITH THE DISSOLUTION OF RUDE  TRIBAL COMMUNISMAND THE RISE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY WILL END WITH THE PASSING OF PRIVATEPROPERTY IN THE MEANS OF SOCIAL EXISTENCE    BUT I DISAGREE WITH YOU   THE BISHOP INTERPOSED  HIS PALE  ASCETIC FACEBETRAYING BY A FAINT GLOW THE INTENSITY OF HIS FEELINGS   YOUR PREMISEIS WRONG  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN LABORAND CAPITAL  OR  RATHER  THERE OUGHT NOT TO BE   THANK YOU   ERNEST SAID GRAVELY   BY THAT LAST STATEMENT YOU HAVE GIVENME BACK MY PREMISE   BUT WHY SHOULD THERE BE A CONFLICT   THE BISHOP DEMANDED WARMLY ERNEST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS   BECAUSE WE ARE SO MADE  I GUESS   BUT WE ARE NOT SO MADE   CRIED THE OTHER  ARE YOU DISCUSSING THE IDEAL MAN   ERNEST ASKED     UNSELFISH ANDGODLIKE  AND SO FEW IN NUMBERS AS TO BE PRACTICALLY NON EXISTENT  OR AREYOU DISCUSSING THE COMMON AND ORDINARY AVERAGE MAN   THE COMMON AND ORDINARY MAN   WAS THE ANSWER  WHO IS WEAK AND FALLIBLE  PRONE TO ERROR  BISHOP MOREHOUSE NODDED  AND PETTY AND SELFISH  AGAIN HE NODDED  WATCH OUT   ERNEST WARNED   I SAID  SELFISH    THE AVERAGE MAN IS SELFISH   THE BISHOP AFFIRMED VALIANTLY  WANTS ALL HE

WEREN T FOR CAPITAL   THE BISHOP INTERRUPTED  TRUE  AND YOU WILL GRANT THAT CAPITAL WOULD PERISH IF THERE WERE NOLABOR TO EARN THE DIVIDENDS  THE BISHOP WAS SILENT  WON T YOU   ERNEST INSISTED THE BISHOP NODDED  THEN OUR STATEMENTS CANCEL EACH OTHER   ERNEST SAID IN A MATTER OF FACTTONE   AND WE ARE WHERE WE WERE  NOW TO BEGIN AGAIN  THE WORKINGMENON THE STREET RAILWAY FURNISH THE LABOR  THE STOCKHOLDERS FURNISH THECAPITAL  BY THE JOINT EFFORT OF THE WORKINGMEN AND THE CAPITAL  MONEY ISEARNED   THEY DIVIDE BETWEEN THEM THIS MONEY THAT IS EARNED  CAPITAL SSHARE IS CALLED  DIVIDENDS   LABOR S SHARE IS CALLED  WAGES          IN THOSE DAYS  GROUPS OF PREDATORY INDIVIDUALS CONTROLLED     ALL THE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION  AND FOR THE USE OF SAME     LEVIED TOLL UPON THE PUBLIC  VERY GOOD   THE BISHOP INTERPOSED   AND THERE IS NO REASON THAT THEDIVISION SHOULD NOT BE AMICABLE   YOU HAVE ALREADY FORGOTTEN WHAT WE HAD AGREED UPON   ERNEST REPLIED  WE AGREED THAT THE AVERAGE MAN IS SELFISH  HE IS THE MAN THAT IS  YOUHAVE GONE UP IN THE AIR AND ARE ARRANGING A DIVISION BETWEEN THE KINDOF MEN THAT OUGHT TO BE BUT ARE NOT  BUT TO RETURN TO THE EARTH  THEWORKINGMAN  BEING SELFISH  WANTS ALL HE CAN GET IN THE DIVISION  THECAPITALIST  BEING SELFISH  WANTS ALL HE CAN GET IN THE DIVISION  WHENTHERE IS ONLY SO MUCH OF THE SAME THING  AND WHEN TWO MEN WANT ALL THEYCAN GET OF THE SAME THING  THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN LABORAND CAPITAL  AND IT IS AN IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT  AS LONG AS WORKINGMENAND CAPITALISTS EXIST  THEY WILL CONTINUE TO QUARREL OVER THE DIVISION IF YOU WERE IN SAN FRANCISCO THIS AFTERNOON  YOU D HAVE TO WALK  THEREISN T A STREET CAR RUNNING   ANOTHER STRIKE    THE BISHOP QUERIED WITH ALARM        THESE QUARRELS WERE VERY COMMON IN THOSE IRRATIONAL AND     ANARCHIC TIMES   SOMETIMES THE LABORERS REFUSED TO WORK      SOMETIMES THE CAPITALISTS REFUSED TO LET THE LABORERS WORK      IN THE VIOLENCE AND TURBULENCE OF SUCH DISAGREEMENTS MUCH     PROPERTY WAS DESTROYED AND MANY LIVES LOST   ALL THIS IS     INCONCEIVABLE TO US  AS INCONCEIVABLE AS ANOTHER CUSTOM OF     THAT TIME  NAMELY  THE HABIT THE MEN OF THE LOWER CLASSES     HAD OF BREAKING THE FURNITURE WHEN THEY QUARRELLED WITH     THEIR WIVES  YES  THEY RE QUARRELLING OVER THE DIVISION OF THE EARNINGS OF THESTREET RAILWAYS  BISHOP MOREHOUSE BECAME EXCITED  IT IS WRONG   HE CRIED   IT IS SO SHORT SIGHTED ON THE PART OF THEWORKINGMEN  HOW CAN THEY HOPE TO KEEP OUR SYMPATHY    WHEN WE ARE COMPELLED TO WALK   ERNEST SAID SLYLY BUT BISHOP MOREHOUSE IGNORED HIM AND WENT ON  THEIR OUTLOOK IS TOO NARROW  MEN SHOULD BE MEN  NOT BRUTES  THERE WILLBE VIOLENCE AND MURDER NOW  AND SORROWING WIDOWS AND ORPHANS  CAPITALAND LABOR SHOULD BE FRIENDS  THEY SHOULD WORK HAND IN HAND AND TO THEIRMUTUAL BENEFIT   AH  NOW YOU ARE UP IN THE AIR AGAIN   ERNEST REMARKED DRYLY   COME BACKTO EARTH  REMEMBER  WE AGREED THAT THE AVERAGE MAN IS SELFISH   BUT HE OUGHT NOT TO BE   THE BISHOP CRIED  AND THERE I AGREE WITH YOU   WAS ERNEST S REJOINDER   HE OUGHT NOT TOBE SELFISH  BUT HE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SELFISH AS LONG AS HE LIVES IN ASOCIAL SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON PIG ETHICS  THE BISHOP WAS AGHAST  AND MY FATHER CHUCKLED  YES  PIG ETHICS   ERNEST WENT ON REMORSELESSLY   THAT IS THE MEANINGOF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM  AND THAT IS WHAT YOUR CHURCH IS STANDINGFOR  WHAT YOU ARE PREACHING FOR EVERY TIME YOU GET UP IN THE PULPIT PIG ETHICS  THERE IS NO OTHER NAME FOR IT  BISHOP MOREHOUSE TURNED APPEALINGLY TO MY FATHER  BUT HE LAUGHED ANDNODDED HIS HEAD  I M AFRAID MR  EVERHARD IS RIGHT   HE SAID   LAISSEZ FAIRE  THELET ALONE POLICY OF EACH FOR HIMSELF AND DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST  AS MR EVERHARD SAID THE OTHER NIGHT  THE FUNCTION YOU CHURCHMEN PERFORM IS TOMAINTAIN THE ESTABLISHED ORDER OF SOCIETY  AND SOCIETY IS ESTABLISHED ONTHAT FOUNDATION   BUT THAT IS NOT THE TEACHING OF CHRIST   CRIED THE BISHOP  THE CHURCH IS NOT TEACHING CHRIST THESE DAYS   ERNEST PUT IN QUICKLY  THAT IS WHY THE WORKINGMEN WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHURCH THE CHURCH CONDONES THE FRIGHTFUL BRUTALITY AND SAVAGERY WITH WHICH THECAPITALIST CLASS TREATS THE WORKING CLASS   THE CHURCH DOES NOT CONDONE IT   THE BISHOP OBJECTED  THE CHURCH DOES NOT PROTEST AGAINST IT   ERNEST REPLIED   AND IN SO FARAS THE CHURCH DOES NOT PROTEST  IT CONDONES  FOR REMEMBER THE CHURCH ISSUPPORTED BY THE CAPITALIST CLASS   I HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT IN THAT LIGHT   THE BISHOP SAID NAIVELY   YOUMUST BE WRONG  I KNOW THAT THERE IS MUCH THAT IS SAD AND WICKED INTHIS WORLD  I KNOW THAT THE CHURCH HAS LOST THE  WHAT YOU CALL THEPROLETARIAT          PROLETARIAT  DERIVED ORIGINALLY FROM THE LATIN PROLETARII      THE NAME GIVEN IN THE CENSUS OF SERVIUS TULLIUS TO THOSE WHO     WERE OF VALUE TO THE STATE ONLY AS THE REARERS OF OFFSPRING      PROLES   IN OTHER WORDS  THEY WERE OF NO IMPORTANCE EITHER     FOR WEALTH  OR POSITION  OR EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY  YOU NEVER HAD THE PROLETARIAT   ERNEST CRIED   THE PROLETARIAT HASGROWN UP OUTSIDE THE CHURCH AND WITHOUT THE CHURCH   I DO NOT FOLLOW YOU   THE BISHOP SAID FAINTLY  THEN LET ME EXPLAIN  WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY AND THE FACTORYSYSTEM IN THE LATTER PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY  THE GREAT MASS OFTHE WORKING PEOPLE WAS SEPARATED FROM THE LAND  THE OLD SYSTEM OF LABORWAS BROKEN DOWN  THE WORKING PEOPLE WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR VILLAGES ANDHERDED IN FACTORY TOWNS  THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN WERE PUT TO WORK ATTHE NEW MACHINES  FAMILY LIFE CEASED  THE CONDITIONS WERE FRIGHTFUL  ITIS A TALE OF BLOOD   I KNOW  I KNOW   BISHOP MOREHOUSE INTERRUPTED WITH AN AGONIZEDEXPRESSION ON HIS FACE   IT WAS TERRIBLE  BUT IT OCCURRED A CENTURY ANDA HALF AGO   AND THERE  A CENTURY AND A HALF AGO  ORIGINATED THE MODERNPROLETARIAT   ERNEST CONTINUED   AND THE CHURCH IGNORED IT  WHILE ASLAUGHTER HOUSE WAS MADE OF THE NATION BY THE CAPITALIST  THE CHURCHWAS DUMB  IT DID NOT PROTEST  AS TO DAY IT DOES NOT PROTEST  AS AUSTINLEWIS  SAYS  SPEAKING OF THAT TIME  THOSE TO WHOM THE COMMAND  FEED MYLAMBS  HAD BEEN GIVEN  SAW THOSE LAMBS SOLD INTO SLAVERY AND WORKED TODEATH WITHOUT A PROTEST    THE CHURCH WAS DUMB  THEN  AND BEFORE I GO ONI WANT YOU EITHER FLATLY TO AGREE WITH ME OR FLATLY TO DISAGREE WITH ME WAS THE CHURCH DUMB THEN         CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA ON THE SOCIALIST     TICKET IN THE FALL ELECTION OF      CHRISTIAN ERA   AN     ENGLISHMAN BY BIRTH  A WRITER OF MANY BOOKS ON POLITICAL     ECONOMY AND PHILOSOPHY  AND ONE OF THE SOCIALIST LEADERS OF     THE TIMES         THERE IS NO MORE HORRIBLE PAGE IN HISTORY THAN THE     TREATMENT OF THE CHILD AND WOMEN SLAVES IN THE ENGLISH     FACTORIES IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OF     THE CHRISTIAN ERA   IN SUCH INDUSTRIAL HELLS AROSE SOME OF     THE PROUDEST FORTUNES OF THAT DAY BISHOP MOREHOUSE HESITATED  LIKE DR  HAMMERFIELD  HE WAS UNUSED TO THISFIERCE  INFIGHTING   AS ERNEST CALLED IT  THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN   ERNEST PROMPTED   IFTHE CHURCH WAS NOT DUMB  IT WILL BE FOUND NOT DUMB IN THE BOOKS   I AM AFRAID THE CHURCH WAS DUMB   THE BISHOP CONFESSED  AND THE CHURCH IS DUMB TO DAY   THERE I DISAGREE   SAID THE BISHOP ERNEST PAUSED  LOOKED AT HIM SEARCHINGLY  AND ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE  ALL RIGHT   HE SAID   LET US SEE  IN CHICAGO THERE ARE WOMEN WHO TOILALL THE WEEK FOR NINETY CENTS  HAS THE CHURCH PROTESTED   THIS IS NEWS TO ME   WAS THE ANSWER   NINETY CENTS PER WEEK  IT ISHORRIBLE   HAS THE CHURCH PROTESTED   ERNEST INSISTED  THE CHURCH DOES NOT KNOW   THE BISHOP WAS STRUGGLING HARD  YET THE COMMAND TO THE CHURCH WAS   FEED MY LAMBS    ERNEST SNEERED AND THEN  THE NEXT MOMENT   PARDON MY SNEER  BISHOP  BUT CAN YOUWONDER THAT WE LOSE PATIENCE WITH YOU  WHEN HAVE YOU PROTESTED TO YOURCAPITALISTIC CONGREGATIONS AT THE WORKING OF CHILDREN IN THE SOUTHERNCOTTON MILLS   CHILDREN  SIX AND SEVEN YEARS OF AGE  WORKING EVERY NIGHTAT TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS  THEY NEVER SEE THE BLESSED SUNSHINE  THEY DIELIKE FLIES  THE DIVIDENDS ARE PAID OUT OF THEIR BLOOD  AND OUT OF THEDIVIDENDS MAGNIFICENT CHURCHES ARE BUILDED IN NEW ENGLAND  WHEREIN YOURKIND PREACHES PLEASANT PLATITUDES TO THE SLEEK  FULL BELLIED RECIPIENTSOF THOSE DIVIDENDS         EVERHARD MIGHT HAVE DRAWN A BETTER ILLUSTRATION FROM THE     SOUTHERN CHURCH S OUTSPOKEN DEFENCE OF CHATTEL SLAVERY PRIOR     TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE  WAR OF THE REBELLION    SEVERAL     SUCH ILLUSTRATIONS  CULLED FROM THE DOCUMENTS OF THE TIMES      ARE HERE APPENDED   IN      A D   THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF     THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH RESOLVED THAT   SLAVERY IS     RECOGNIZED IN BOTH THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENTS  AND IS     NOT CONDEMNED BY THE AUTHORITY OF GOD    THE CHARLESTON     BAPTIST ASSOCIATION ISSUED THE FOLLOWING  IN AN ADDRESS  IN          A D    THE RIGHT OF MASTERS TO DISPOSE OF THE TIME OF     THEIR SLAVES HAS BEEN DISTINCTLY RECOGNIZED BY THE CREATOR     OF ALL THINGS  WHO IS SURELY AT LIBERTY TO VEST THE RIGHT OF     PROPERTY OVER ANY OBJECT WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASES    THE REV      E  D  SIMON  DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND PROFESSOR IN THE     RANDOLPH MACON METHODIST COLLEGE OF VIRGINIA  WROTE       EXTRACTS FROM HOLY WRIT UNEQUIVOCALLY ASSERT THE RIGHT OF     PROPERTY IN SLAVES  TOGETHER WITH THE USUAL INCIDENTS TO     THAT RIGHT   THE RIGHT TO BUY AND SELL IS CLEARLY STATED      UPON THE WHOLE  THEN  WHETHER WE CONSULT THE JEWISH POLICY     INSTITUTED BY GOD HIMSELF  OR THE UNIFORM OPINION AND     PRACTICE OF MANKIND IN ALL AGES  OR THE INJUNCTIONS OF THE     NEW TESTAMENT AND THE MORAL LAW  WE ARE BROUGHT TO THE     CONCLUSION THAT SLAVERY IS NOT IMMORAL   HAVING ESTABLISHED     THE POINT THAT THE FIRST AFRICAN SLAVES WERE LEGALLY BROUGHT     INTO BONDAGE  THE RIGHT TO DETAIN THEIR CHILDREN IN BONDAGE     FOLLOWS AS AN INDISPENSABLE CONSEQUENCE   THUS WE SEE THAT     THE SLAVERY THAT EXISTS IN AMERICA WAS FOUNDED IN RIGHT       IT IS NOT AT ALL REMARKABLE THAT THIS SAME NOTE SHOULD HAVE     BEEN STRUCK BY THE CHURCH A GENERATION OR SO LATER IN     RELATION TO THE DEFENCE OF CAPITALISTIC PROPERTY   IN THE     GREAT MUSEUM AT ASGARD THERE IS A BOOK ENTITLED  ESSAYS IN     APPLICATION   WRITTEN BY HENRY VAN DYKE   THE BOOK WAS     PUBLISHED IN      OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA  FROM WHAT WE CAN     MAKE OUT  VAN DYKE MUST HAVE BEEN A CHURCHMAN  THE BOOK IS A     GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT EVERHARD WOULD HAVE CALLED BOURGEOIS     THINKING   NOTE THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE UTTERANCE OF THE     CHARLESTON BAPTIST ASSOCIATION QUOTED ABOVE  AND THE     FOLLOWING UTTERANCE OF VAN DYKE SEVENTY YEARS LATER   THE     BIBLE TEACHES THAT GOD OWNS THE WORLD   HE DISTRIBUTES TO     EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE  CONFORMABLY TO     GENERAL LAWS   I DID NOT KNOW   THE BISHOP MURMURED FAINTLY  HIS FACE WAS PALE  AND HESEEMED SUFFERING FROM NAUSEA  THEN YOU HAVE NOT PROTESTED  THE BISHOP SHOOK HIS HEAD  THEN THE CHURCH IS DUMB TO DAY  AS IT WAS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY  THE BISHOP WAS SILENT  AND FOR ONCE ERNEST FORBORE TO PRESS THE POINT  AND DO NOT FORGET  WHENEVER A CHURCHMAN DOES PROTEST  THAT HE ISDISCHARGED   I HARDLY THINK THAT IS FAIR   WAS THE OBJECTION  WILL YOU PROTEST   ERNEST DEMANDED  SHOW ME EVILS  SUCH AS YOU MENTION  IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY  AND I WILLPROTEST   I LL SHOW YOU   ERNEST SAID QUIETLY   I AM AT YOUR DISPOSAL  I WILLTAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY THROUGH HELL   AND I SHALL PROTEST   THE BISHOP STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF IN HIS CHAIR  ANDOVER HIS GENTLE FACE SPREAD THE HARSHNESS OF THE WARRIOR   THE CHURCHSHALL NOT BE DUMB   YOU WILL BE DISCHARGED   WAS THE WARNING  I SHALL PROVE THE CONTRARY   WAS THE RETORT   I SHALL PROVE  IFWHAT YOU SAY IS SO  THAT THE CHURCH HAS ERRED THROUGH IGNORANCE  AND FURTHERMORE  I HOLD THAT WHATEVER IS HORRIBLE IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY ISDUE TO THE IGNORANCE OF THE CAPITALIST CLASS  IT WILL MEND ALL THAT ISWRONG AS SOON AS IT RECEIVES THE MESSAGE  AND THIS MESSAGE IT SHALL BETHE DUTY OF THE CHURCH TO DELIVER  ERNEST LAUGHED  HE LAUGHED BRUTALLY  AND I WAS DRIVEN TO THE BISHOP SDEFENCE  REMEMBER   I SAID   YOU SEE BUT ONE SIDE OF THE SHIELD  THERE ISMUCH GOOD IN US  THOUGH YOU GIVE US CREDIT FOR NO GOOD AT ALL  BISHOPMOREHOUSE IS RIGHT  THE INDUSTRIAL WRONG  TERRIBLE AS YOU SAY IT IS IS DUE TO IGNORANCE  THE DIVISIONS OF SOCIETY HAVE BECOME TOO WIDELYSEPARATED   THE WILD INDIAN IS NOT SO BRUTAL AND SAVAGE AS THE CAPITALIST CLASS  HE ANSWERED  AND IN THAT MOMENT I HATED HIM  YOU DO NOT KNOW US   I ANSWERED   WE ARE NOT BRUTAL AND SAVAGE   PROVE IT   HE CHALLENGED  HOW CAN I PROVE IT       TO YOU   I WAS GROWING ANGRY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD   I DO NOT ASK YOU TO PROVE IT TO ME  I ASK YOU TOPROVE IT TO YOURSELF   I KNOW   I SAID  YOU KNOW NOTHING   WAS HIS RUDE REPLY  THERE  THERE  CHILDREN   FATHER SAID SOOTHINGLY  I DON T CARE    I BEGAN INDIGNANTLY  BUT ERNEST INTERRUPTED  I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE MONEY  OR YOUR FATHER HAS  WHICH IS THE SAMETHING  MONEY INVESTED IN THE SIERRA MILLS   WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT   I CRIED  NOTHING MUCH   HE BEGAN SLOWLY   EXCEPT THAT THE GOWN YOU WEAR ISSTAINED WITH BLOOD  THE FOOD YOU EAT IS A BLOODY STEW  THE BLOOD OFLITTLE CHILDREN AND OF STRONG MEN IS DRIPPING FROM YOUR VERY ROOF BEAMS I CAN CLOSE MY EYES  NOW  AND HEAR IT DRIP  DROP  DRIP  DROP  ALL ABOUTME  AND SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORDS  HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND LEANED BACKIN HIS CHAIR  I BURST INTO TEARS OF MORTIFICATION AND HURT VANITY  I HADNEVER BEEN SO BRUTALLY TREATED IN MY LIFE  BOTH THE BISHOP AND MY FATHERWERE EMBARRASSED AND PERTURBED  THEY TRIED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATIONAWAY INTO EASIER CHANNELS  BUT ERNEST OPENED HIS EYES  LOOKED AT ME AND WAVED THEM ASIDE  HIS MOUTH WAS STERN  AND HIS EYES TOO  AND IN THELATTER THERE WAS NO GLINT OF LAUGHTER  WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY  WHATTERRIBLE CASTIGATION HE WAS GOING TO GIVE ME  I NEVER KNEW  FOR AT THATMOMENT A MAN  PASSING ALONG THE SIDEWALK  STOPPED AND GLANCED IN AT US HE WAS A LARGE MAN  POORLY DRESSED  AND ON HIS BACK WAS A GREAT LOAD OFRATTAN AND BAMBOO STANDS  CHAIRS  AND SCREENS  HE LOOKED AT THE HOUSE ASIF DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD COME IN AND TRY TO SELL SOME OF HISWARES  THAT MAN S NAME IS JACKSON   ERNEST SAID  WITH THAT STRONG BODY OF HIS HE SHOULD BE AT WORK  AND NOT PEDDLING   I ANSWERED CURTLY        IN THAT DAY THERE WERE MANY THOUSANDS OF THESE POOR     MERCHANTS CALLED PEDLERS   THEY CARRIED THEIR WHOLE STOCK IN     TRADE FROM DOOR TO DOOR   IT WAS A MOST WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE     OF ENERGY  DISTRIBUTION WAS AS CONFUSED AND IRRATIONAL AS     THE WHOLE GENERAL SYSTEM OF SOCIETY  NOTICE THE SLEEVE OF HIS LEFT ARM   ERNEST SAID GENTLY I LOOKED  AND SAW THAT THE SLEEVE WAS EMPTY  IT WAS SOME OF THE BLOOD FROM THAT ARM THAT I HEARD DRIPPING FROM YOURROOF BEAMS   ERNEST SAID WITH CONTINUED GENTLENESS   HE LOST HIS ARM INTHE SIERRA MILLS  AND LIKE A BROKEN DOWN HORSE YOU TURNED HIM OUT ONTHE HIGHWAY TO DIE  WHEN I SAY  YOU   I MEAN THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THEOFFICIALS THAT YOU AND THE OTHER STOCKHOLDERS PAY TO MANAGE THE MILLSFOR YOU  IT WAS AN ACCIDENT  IT WAS CAUSED BY HIS TRYING TO SAVE THECOMPANY A FEW DOLLARS  THE TOOTHED DRUM OF THE PICKER CAUGHT HIS ARM  HEMIGHT HAVE LET THE SMALL FLINT THAT HE SAW IN THE TEETH GO THROUGH  ITWOULD HAVE SMASHED OUT A DOUBLE ROW OF SPIKES  BUT HE REACHED FOR THEFLINT  AND HIS ARM WAS PICKED AND CLAWED TO SHREDS FROM THE FINGER TIPSTO THE SHOULDER  IT WAS AT NIGHT  THE MILLS WERE WORKING OVERTIME  THEYPAID A FAT DIVIDEND THAT QUARTER  JACKSON HAD BEEN WORKING MANY HOURS AND HIS MUSCLES HAD LOST THEIR RESILIENCY AND SNAP  THEY MADE HISMOVEMENTS A BIT SLOW  THAT WAS WHY THE MACHINE CAUGHT HIM  HE HAD A WIFEAND THREE CHILDREN   AND WHAT DID THE COMPANY DO FOR HIM   I ASKED  NOTHING  OH  YES  THEY DID DO SOMETHING  THEY SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT THEDAMAGE SUIT HE BROUGHT WHEN HE CAME OUT OF HOSPITAL  THE COMPANY EMPLOYSVERY EFFICIENT LAWYERS  YOU KNOW   YOU HAVE NOT TOLD THE WHOLE STORY   I SAID WITH CONVICTION   OR ELSEYOU DO NOT KNOW THE WHOLE STORY  MAYBE THE MAN WAS INSOLENT   INSOLENT  HA  HA   HIS LAUGHTER WAS MEPHISTOPHELIAN   GREAT GOD INSOLENT  AND WITH HIS ARM CHEWED OFF  NEVERTHELESS HE WAS A MEEK ANDLOWLY SERVANT  AND THERE IS NO RECORD OF HIS HAVING BEEN INSOLENT   BUT THE COURTS   I URGED   THE CASE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DECIDED AGAINSTHIM HAD THERE BEEN NO MORE TO THE AFFAIR THAN YOU HAVE MENTIONED   COLONEL INGRAM IS LEADING COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY  HE IS A SHREWDLAWYER   ERNEST LOOKED AT ME INTENTLY FOR A MOMENT  THEN WENT ON   I LLTELL YOU WHAT YOU DO  MISS CUNNINGHAM  YOU INVESTIGATE JACKSON S CASE   I HAD ALREADY DETERMINED TO   I SAID COLDLY  ALL RIGHT   HE BEAMED GOOD NATUREDLY   AND I LL TELL YOU WHERE TOFIND HIM  BUT I TREMBLE FOR YOU WHEN I THINK OF ALL YOU ARE TO PROVE BYJACKSON S ARM  AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT BOTH THE BISHOP AND I ACCEPTED ERNEST SCHALLENGES  THEY WENT AWAY TOGETHER  LEAVING ME SMARTING WITH A SENSEOF INJUSTICE THAT HAD BEEN DONE ME AND MY CLASS  THE MAN WAS A BEAST  IHATED HIM  THEN  AND CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HIS BEHAVIORWAS WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A MAN OF THE WORKING CLASS CHAPTER IIIJACKSON S ARM LITTLE DID I DREAM THE FATEFUL PART JACKSON S ARM WAS TO PLAY IN MYLIFE  JACKSON HIMSELF DID NOT IMPRESS ME WHEN I HUNTED HIM OUT  I FOUNDHIM IN A CRAZY  RAMSHACKLE  HOUSE DOWN NEAR THE BAY ON THE EDGE OF THEMARSH  POOLS OF STAGNANT WATER STOOD AROUND THE HOUSE  THEIR SURFACESCOVERED WITH A GREEN AND PUTRID LOOKING SCUM  WHILE THE STENCH THATAROSE FROM THEM WAS INTOLERABLE        AN ADJECTIVE DESCRIPTIVE OF RUINED AND DILAPIDATED HOUSES     IN WHICH GREAT NUMBERS OF THE WORKING PEOPLE FOUND SHELTER     IN THOSE DAYS   THEY INVARIABLY PAID RENT  AND  CONSIDERING     THE VALUE OF SUCH HOUSES  ENORMOUS RENT  TO THE LANDLORDS I FOUND JACKSON THE MEEK AND LOWLY MAN HE HAD BEEN DESCRIBED  HE WASMAKING SOME SORT OF RATTAN WORK  AND HE TOILED ON STOLIDLY WHILE ITALKED WITH HIM  BUT IN SPITE OF HIS MEEKNESS AND LOWLINESS  I FANCIED ICAUGHT THE FIRST NOTE OF A NASCENT BITTERNESS IN HIM WHEN HE SAID  THEY MIGHT A GIVEN ME A JOB AS WATCHMAN   ANYWAY         IN THOSE DAYS THIEVERY WAS INCREDIBLY PREVALENT      EVERYBODY STOLE PROPERTY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE   THE LORDS OF     SOCIETY STOLE LEGALLY OR ELSE LEGALIZED THEIR STEALING      WHILE THE POORER CLASSES STOLE ILLEGALLY   NOTHING WAS SAFE     UNLESS GUARDED   ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF MEN WERE EMPLOYED AS     WATCHMEN TO PROTECT PROPERTY   THE HOUSES OF THE WELL TO DO     WERE A COMBINATION OF SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT AND FORTRESS   THE     APPROPRIATION OF THE PERSONAL BELONGINGS OF OTHERS BY OUR     OWN CHILDREN OF TO DAY IS LOOKED UPON AS A RUDIMENTARY     SURVIVAL OF THE THEFT CHARACTERISTIC THAT IN THOSE EARLY     TIMES WAS UNIVERSAL I GOT LITTLE OUT OF HIM  HE STRUCK ME AS STUPID  AND YET THE DEFTNESSWITH WHICH HE WORKED WITH HIS ONE HAND SEEMED TO BELIE HIS STUPIDITY THIS SUGGESTED AN IDEA TO ME  HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO GET YOUR ARM CAUGHT IN THE MACHINE   I ASKED HE LOOKED AT ME IN A SLOW AND PONDERING WAY  AND SHOOK HIS HEAD   IDON T KNOW  IT JUST HAPPENED   CARELESSNESS   I PROMPTED  NO   HE ANSWERED   I AIN T FOR CALLIN  IT THAT  I WAS WORKIN  OVERTIME AN  I GUESS I WAS TIRED OUT SOME  I WORKED SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THEMMILLS  AN  I VE TOOK NOTICE THAT MOST OF THE ACCIDENTS HAPPENS JUSTBEFORE WHISTLE BLOW   I M WILLIN  TO BET THAT MORE ACCIDENTS HAPPENSIN THE HOUR BEFORE WHISTLE BLOW THAN IN ALL THE REST OF THE DAY  A MANAIN T SO QUICK AFTER WORKIN  STEADY FOR HOURS  I VE SEEN TOO MANY OF  EMCUT UP AN  GOUGED AN  CHAWED NOT TO KNOW         THE LABORERS WERE CALLED TO WORK AND DISMISSED BY SAVAGE      SCREAMING  NERVE RACKING STEAM WHISTLES  MANY OF THEM   I QUERIED  HUNDREDS AN  HUNDREDS  AN  CHILDREN  TOO  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TERRIBLE DETAILS  JACKSON S STORY OF HISACCIDENT WAS THE SAME AS THAT I HAD ALREADY HEARD  WHEN I ASKED HIM IFHE HAD BROKEN SOME RULE OF WORKING THE MACHINERY  HE SHOOK HIS HEAD  I CHUCKED OFF THE BELT WITH MY RIGHT HAND   HE SAID   AN  MADE A REACHFOR THE FLINT WITH MY LEFT  I DIDN T STOP TO SEE IF THE BELT WAS OFF  ITHOUGHT MY RIGHT HAND HAD DONE IT  ONLY IT DIDN T  I REACHED QUICK  ANDTHE BELT WASN T ALL THE WAY OFF  AND THEN MY ARM WAS CHEWED OFF   IT MUST HAVE BEEN PAINFUL   I SAID SYMPATHETICALLY  THE CRUNCHIN  OF THE BONES WASN T NICE   WAS HIS ANSWER HIS MIND WAS RATHER HAZY CONCERNING THE DAMAGE SUIT  ONLY ONE THING WASCLEAR TO HIM  AND THAT WAS THAT HE HAD NOT GOT ANY DAMAGES  HE HAD AFEELING THAT THE TESTIMONY OF THE FOREMEN AND THE SUPERINTENDENT HADBROUGHT ABOUT THE ADVERSE DECISION OF THE COURT  THEIR TESTIMONY  AS HEPUT IT   WASN T WHAT IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEN   AND TO THEM I RESOLVED TOGO ONE THING WAS PLAIN  JACKSON S SITUATION WAS WRETCHED  HIS WIFE WAS INILL HEALTH  AND HE WAS UNABLE TO EARN  BY HIS RATTAN WORK AND PEDDLING SUFFICIENT FOOD FOR THE FAMILY  HE WAS BACK IN HIS RENT  AND THE OLDESTBOY  A LAD OF ELEVEN  HAD STARTED TO WORK IN THE MILLS  THEY MIGHT A GIVEN ME THAT WATCHMAN S JOB   WERE HIS LAST WORDS AS IWENT AWAY BY THE TIME I HAD SEEN THE LAWYER WHO HAD HANDLED JACKSON S CASE  ANDTHE TWO FOREMEN AND THE SUPERINTENDENT AT THE MILLS WHO HAD TESTIFIED  IBEGAN TO FEEL THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING AFTER ALL IN ERNEST S CONTENTION HE WAS A WEAK AND INEFFICIENT LOOKING MAN  THE LAWYER  AND AT SIGHT OFHIM I DID NOT WONDER THAT JACKSON S CASE HAD BEEN LOST  MY FIRST THOUGHTWAS THAT IT HAD SERVED JACKSON RIGHT FOR GETTING SUCH A LAWYER  BUTTHE NEXT MOMENT TWO OF ERNEST S STATEMENTS CAME FLASHING INTO MYCONSCIOUSNESS   THE COMPANY EMPLOYS VERY EFFICIENT LAWYERS  AND  COLONELINGRAM IS A SHREWD LAWYER   I DID SOME RAPID THINKING  IT DAWNED UPON METHAT OF COURSE THE COMPANY COULD AFFORD FINER LEGAL TALENT THAN COULD AWORKINGMAN LIKE JACKSON  BUT THIS WAS MERELY A MINOR DETAIL  THERE WASSOME VERY GOOD REASON  I WAS SURE  WHY JACKSON S CASE HAD GONE AGAINSTHIM  WHY DID YOU LOSE THE CASE   I ASKED THE LAWYER WAS PERPLEXED AND WORRIED FOR A MOMENT  AND I FOUND IT IN MYHEART TO PITY THE WRETCHED LITTLE CREATURE  THEN HE BEGAN TO WHINE  IDO BELIEVE HIS WHINE WAS CONGENITAL  HE WAS A MAN BEATEN AT BIRTH  HEWHINED ABOUT THE TESTIMONY  THE WITNESSES HAD GIVEN ONLY THE EVIDENCETHAT HELPED THE OTHER SIDE  NOT ONE WORD COULD HE GET OUT OF THEM THATWOULD HAVE HELPED JACKSON  THEY KNEW WHICH SIDE THEIR BREAD WAS BUTTEREDON  JACKSON WAS A FOOL  HE HAD BEEN BROW BEATEN AND CONFUSED BY COLONELINGRAM  COLONEL INGRAM WAS BRILLIANT AT CROSS EXAMINATION  HE HAD MADEJACKSON ANSWER DAMAGING QUESTIONS  HOW COULD HIS ANSWERS BE DAMAGING IF HE HAD THE RIGHT ON HIS SIDE   IDEMANDED  WHAT S RIGHT GOT TO DO WITH IT   HE DEMANDED BACK   YOU SEE ALL THOSEBOOKS   HE MOVED HIS HAND OVER THE ARRAY OF VOLUMES ON THE WALLS OF HISTINY OFFICE   ALL MY READING AND STUDYING OF THEM HAS TAUGHT ME THATLAW IS ONE THING AND RIGHT IS ANOTHER THING  ASK ANY LAWYER  YOU GO TOSUNDAY SCHOOL TO LEARN WHAT IS RIGHT  BUT YOU GO TO THOSE BOOKS TO LEARN      LAW   DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT JACKSON HAD THE RIGHT ON HIS SIDE AND YETWAS BEATEN   I QUERIED TENTATIVELY   DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THEREIS NO JUSTICE IN JUDGE CALDWELL S COURT  THE LITTLE LAWYER GLARED AT ME A MOMENT  AND THEN THE BELLIGERENCE FADEDOUT OF HIS FACE  I HADN T A FAIR CHANCE   HE BEGAN WHINING AGAIN   THEY MADE A FOOL OUTOF JACKSON AND OUT OF ME  TOO  WHAT CHANCE HAD I  COLONEL INGRAM ISA GREAT LAWYER  IF HE WASN T GREAT  WOULD HE HAVE CHARGE OF THE LAWBUSINESS OF THE SIERRA MILLS  OF THE ERSTON LAND SYNDICATE  OF THEBERKELEY CONSOLIDATED  OF THE OAKLAND  SAN LEANDRO  AND PLEASANTONELECTRIC  HE S A CORPORATION LAWYER  AND CORPORATION LAWYERS ARE NOTPAID FOR BEING FOOLS   WHAT DO YOU THINK THE SIERRA MILLS ALONE GIVE HIMTWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR  BECAUSE HE S WORTH TWENTY THOUSANDDOLLARS A YEAR TO THEM  THAT S WHAT FOR  I M NOT WORTH THAT MUCH  IFI WAS  I WOULDN T BE ON THE OUTSIDE  STARVING AND TAKING CASES LIKEJACKSON S  WHAT DO YOU THINK I D HAVE GOT IF I D WON JACKSON S CASE         THE FUNCTION OF THE CORPORATION LAWYER WAS TO SERVE  BY     CORRUPT METHODS  THE MONEY GRABBING PROPENSITIES OF THE     CORPORATIONS   IT IS ON RECORD THAT THEODORE ROOSEVELT  AT     THAT TIME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  SAID IN      A D       IN HIS ADDRESS AT HARVARD COMMENCEMENT   WE ALL KNOW THAT      AS THINGS ACTUALLY ARE  MANY OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AND     MOST HIGHLY REMUNERATED MEMBERS OF THE BAR IN EVERY CENTRE     OF WEALTH  MAKE IT THEIR SPECIAL TASK TO WORK OUT BOLD AND     INGENIOUS SCHEMES BY WHICH THEIR WEALTHY CLIENTS  INDIVIDUAL     OR CORPORATE  CAN EVADE THE LAWS WHICH WERE MADE TO     REGULATE  IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC  THE USES OF GREAT     WEALTH   YOU D HAVE ROBBED HIM  MOST PROBABLY   I ANSWERED  OF COURSE I WOULD   HE CRIED ANGRILY   I VE GOT TO LIVE  HAVEN T I          A TYPICAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE INTERNECINE STRIFE THAT     PERMEATED ALL SOCIETY   MEN PREYED UPON ONE ANOTHER LIKE     RAVENING WOLVES  THE BIG WOLVES ATE THE LITTLE WOLVES  AND     IN THE SOCIAL PACK JACKSON WAS ONE OF THE LEAST OF THE     LITTLE WOLVES  HE HAS A WIFE AND CHILDREN   I CHIDED  SO HAVE I A WIFE AND CHILDREN   HE RETORTED   AND THERE S NOT A SOUL INTHIS WORLD EXCEPT MYSELF THAT CARES WHETHER THEY STARVE OR NOT  HIS FACE SUDDENLY SOFTENED  AND HE OPENED HIS WATCH AND SHOWED ME ASMALL PHOTOGRAPH OF A WOMAN

SAYING THAT IF I D GOT THE RIGHT KIND OFTESTIMONY OUT OF THEIR WITNESSES ON CROSS EXAMINATION  THAT FRIENDSHIPWOULD HAVE DECIDED THE CASE  AND YET I MUST SAY THAT JUDGE CALDWELLDID A WHOLE LOT TO PREVENT MY GETTING THAT VERY TESTIMONY  WHY  JUDGECALDWELL AND COLONEL INGRAM BELONG TO THE SAME LODGE AND THE SAME CLUB THEY LIVE IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD  ONE I CAN T AFFORD  AND THEIR WIVESARE ALWAYS IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER S HOUSES  THEY RE ALWAYS HAVINGWHIST PARTIES AND SUCH THINGS BACK AND FORTH   AND YET YOU THINK JACKSON HAD THE RIGHT OF IT   I ASKED  PAUSING FORTHE MOMENT ON THE THRESHOLD  I DON T THINK  I KNOW IT   WAS HIS ANSWER   AND AT FIRST I THOUGHTHE HAD SOME SHOW  TOO  BUT I DIDN T TELL MY WIFE  I DIDN T WANT TODISAPPOINT HER  SHE HAD HER HEART SET ON A TRIP TO THE COUNTRY HARDENOUGH AS IT WAS   WHY DID YOU NOT CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT JACKSON WAS TRYING TOSAVE THE MACHINERY FROM BEING INJURED   I ASKED PETER DONNELLY  ONE OFTHE FOREMEN WHO HAD TESTIFIED AT THE TRIAL HE PONDERED A LONG TIME BEFORE REPLYING  THEN HE CAST AN ANXIOUS LOOKABOUT HIM AND SAID  BECAUSE I VE A GOOD WIFE AN  THREE OF THE SWEETEST CHILDREN YE EVERLAID EYES ON  THAT S WHY   I DO

VULPINE FACED CREATURE WHOREGARDED ME INSOLENTLY AND REFUSED TO TALK  NOT A WORD COULD I GET FROMHIM CONCERNING THE TRIAL AND HIS TESTIMONY  BUT WITH THE OTHER FOREMAN IHAD BETTER LUCK  JAMES SMITH WAS A HARD FACED MAN  AND MY HEART SANKAS I ENCOUNTERED HIM  HE  TOO  GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS NOT AFREE AGENT  AS WE TALKED I BEGAN TO SEE THAT HE WAS MENTALLY SUPERIORTO THE AVERAGE OF HIS KIND  HE AGREED WITH PETER DONNELLY THAT JACKSONSHOULD HAVE GOT DAMAGES  AND HE WENT FARTHER AND CALLED THE ACTIONHEARTLESS AND COLD BLOODED THAT HAD TURNED THE WORKER ADRIFT AFTER HEHAD BEEN MADE HELPLESS BY THE ACCIDENT  ALSO  HE EXPLAINED THAT THEREWERE MANY ACCIDENTS IN THE MILLS  AND THAT THE COMPANY S POLICY WAS TOFIGHT TO THE BITTER END ALL CONSEQUENT DAMAGE SUITS  IT MEANS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS A YEAR TO THE STOCKHOLDERS   HE SAID AND AS HE SPOKE I REMEMBERED THE LAST DIVIDEND THAT HAD BEEN PAID MYFATHER  AND THE PRETTY GOWN FOR ME AND THE BOOKS FOR HIM THAT HAD BEENBOUGHT OUT OF THAT DIVIDEND  I REMEMBERED ERNEST S CHARGE THAT MYGOWN WAS STAINED WITH BLOOD  AND MY FLESH BEGAN TO CRAWL UNDERNEATH MYGARMENTS  WHEN YOU TESTIFIED AT THE TRIAL  YOU DIDN T POINT OUT THAT JACKSONRECEIVED HIS ACCIDENT THROUGH TRYING TO SAVE THE MACHINERY FROM DAMAGE  I SAID  NO  I DID NOT   WAS THE ANSWER  AND HIS MOUTH SET BITTERLY   ITESTIFIED TO THE EFFECT THAT JACKSON INJURED HIMSELF BY NEGLECT ANDCARELESSNESS  AND THAT THE COMPANY WAS NOT IN ANY WAY TO BLAME ORLIABLE   WAS IT CARELESSNESS   I ASKED  CALL IT THAT  OR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO CALL IT  THE FACT IS  A MAN

FACE WAS GROWING DARKER  TELL ME   I WENT ON   WAS IT EASY TO MAKE YOURSELF OVER FROM WHAT YOUWERE  SAY IN HIGH SCHOOL  TO THE MAN YOU MUST HAVE BECOME TO DO SUCH ATHING AT THE TRIAL  THE SUDDENNESS OF HIS OUTBURST STARTLED AND FRIGHTENED ME  HE RIPPED OUT A SAVAGE OATH  AND CLENCHED HIS FIST AS THOUGH ABOUT TO STRIKE ME        IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE VIRILITIES OF LANGUAGE THAT     WERE COMMON SPEECH IN THAT DAY  AS INDICATIVE OF THE LIFE       RED OF CLAW AND FANG   THAT WAS THEN LIVED   REFERENCE IS     HERE MADE  OF COURSE  NOT TO THE OATH OF SMITH  BUT TO THE     VERB RIPPED USED

INTERESTED ATTENTION  AND WAITED FOR ME TO GO ON  THOUGH ICOULD SEE IN HIS EYES THE CERTITUDE THAT MY CONVICTIONS HAD BEEN SHAKEN  HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BADLY TREATED   I CONFESSED   I  I  THINK SOME OFHIS BLOOD IS DRIPPING FROM OUR ROOF BEAMS   OF COURSE   HE ANSWERED   IF JACKSON AND ALL HIS FELLOWS WERE TREATEDMERCIFULLY  THE DIVIDENDS WOULD NOT BE SO LARGE   I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO TAKE PLEASURE IN PRETTY GOWNS AGAIN   I ADDED I FELT HUMBLE AND CONTRITE  AND WAS AWARE OF A SWEET FEELING THATERNEST WAS A SORT OF FATHER CONFESSOR  THEN  AS EVER AFTER  HIS STRENGTHAPPEALED TO ME  IT

NOT THE MEREWEALTH IN THE HOUSES  BUT ALL THE SOURCES OF THAT WEALTH  ALL THEMINES  AND RAILROADS  AND FACTORIES  AND BANKS  AND STORES  THAT ISTHE REVOLUTION  IT IS TRULY PERILOUS  THERE WILL BE MORE SHOOTING  I AMAFRAID  THAN EVEN I DREAM OF  BUT AS I WAS SAYING  NO ONE TO DAY ISA FREE AGENT  WE ARE ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE WHEELS AND COGS OF THEINDUSTRIAL MACHINE  YOU FOUND THAT YOU WERE  AND THAT THE MEN YOU TALKEDWITH WERE  TALK WITH MORE OF THEM  GO AND SEE COLONEL INGRAM  LOOKUP THE REPORTERS THAT KEPT JACKSON S CASE OUT OF THE PAPERS  AND THEEDITORS THAT RUN THE PAPERS  YOU WILL FIND THEM ALL SLAVES OF THEMACHINE  A LITTLE LATER IN OUR CONVERSATION I ASKED HIM A SIMPLE LITTLEQUESTION ABOUT THE LIABILITY OF WORKINGMEN TO ACCIDENTS  AND RECEIVED ASTATISTICAL LECTURE IN RETURN  IT IS ALL IN THE BOOKS   HE SAID   THE FIGURES HAVE BEEN GATHERED  ANDIT HAS BEEN PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THAT ACCIDENTS RARELY OCCUR IN THEFIRST HOURS OF THE MORNING WORK  BUT THAT THEY INCREASE RAPIDLY IN THESUCCEEDING HOURS AS THE WORKERS GROW TIRED AND SLOWER IN BOTH THEIRMUSCULAR AND MENTAL PROCESSES  WHY  DO YOU KNOW THAT YOUR FATHER HAS THREE TIMES AS MANY CHANCES FORSAFETY OF LIFE AND LIMB THAN HAS A WORKING MAN  HE HAS  THE INSURANCE COMPANIES KNOW  THEY WILL CHARGE HIM FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS AYEAR ON A THOUSAND DOLLAR ACCIDENT POLICY  AND FOR THE SAME POLICY THEYWILL CHARGE A LABORER FIFTEEN DOLLARS         IN THE TERRIBLE WOLF STRUGGLE OF THOSE CENTURIES  NO MAN     WAS PERMANENTLY SAFE  NO MATTER HOW MUCH WEALTH HE AMASSED      OUT OF FEAR FOR THE WELFARE OF THEIR FAMILIES  MEN DEVISED     THE SCHEME OF INSURANCE   TO US  IN THIS INTELLIGENT AGE      SUCH A DEVICE IS LAUGHABLY ABSURD AND PRIMITIVE   BUT IN     THAT AGE INSURANCE WAS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER   THE AMUSING     PART OF IT IS THAT THE FUNDS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE     FREQUENTLY PLUNDERED AND WASTED BY THE VERY OFFICIALS WHO     WERE INTRUSTED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THEM  AND YOU   I ASKED  AND IN THE MOMENT OF ASKING I WAS AWARE OF ASOLICITUDE THAT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN SLIGHT  OH  AS A REVOLUTIONIST  I HAVE ABOUT EIGHT CHANCES TO THE WORKINGMAN SONE OF BEING INJURED OR KILLED   HE ANSWERED CARELESSLY   THE INSURANCECOMPANIES CHARGE THE HIGHLY TRAINED CHEMISTS THAT HANDLE EXPLOSIVESEIGHT TIMES WHAT THEY CHARGE THE WORKINGMEN  I DON T THINK THEY D INSUREME AT ALL  WHY DID YOU ASK  MY EYES FLUTTERED  AND I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD WARM IN MY FACE  ITWAS NOT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT ME IN MY SOLICITUDE  BUT THAT I HAD CAUGHTMYSELF  AND IN HIS PRESENCE JUST THEN MY FATHER CAME IN AND BEGAN MAKING PREPARATIONS TO DEPART WITHME  ERNEST RETURNED SOME BOOKS HE HAD BORROWED  AND WENT AWAY FIRST  BUTJUST AS HE WAS GOING  HE TURNED AND SAID  OH  BY THE WAY  WHILE YOU ARE RUINING YOUR OWN PEACE OF MIND AND IAM RUINING THE BISHOP S  YOU D BETTER LOOK UP MRS  WICKSON ANDMRS  PERTONWAITHE  THEIR HUSBANDS  YOU KNOW  ARE THE TWO PRINCIPALSTOCKHOLDERS IN THE MILLS  LIKE ALL THE REST OF HUMANITY  THOSE TWOWOMEN ARE TIED TO THE MACHINE  BUT THEY ARE SO TIED THAT THEY SIT ON TOPOF IT  CHAPTER IVSLAVES OF THE MACHINETHE MORE I THOUGHT OF JACKSON S ARM  THE MORE SHAKEN I WAS  I WASCONFRONTED BY THE CONCRETE  FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS SEEING LIFE  MYUNIVERSITY LIFE  AND STUDY AND CULTURE  HAD NOT BEEN REAL  I HAD LEARNEDNOTHING BUT THEORIES OF LIFE AND SOCIETY THAT LOOKED ALL VERY WELL ONTHE PRINTED PAGE  BUT NOW I HAD SEEN LIFE ITSELF  JACKSON S ARM WAS AFACT OF LIFE   THE FACT  MAN  THE IRREFRAGABLE FACT   OF ERNEST S WASRINGING IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS IT SEEMED MONSTROUS  IMPOSSIBLE  THAT OUR WHOLE SOCIETY WAS BASEDUPON BLOOD  AND YET THERE WAS JACKSON  I COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM CONSTANTLY MY THOUGHT SWUNG BACK TO HIM AS THE COMPASS TO THE POLE  HEHAD BEEN MONSTROUSLY TREATED  HIS BLOOD HAD NOT BEEN PAID FOR IN ORDERTHAT A LARGER DIVIDEND MIGHT BE PAID  AND I KNEW A SCORE OF HAPPYCOMPLACENT FAMILIES THAT HAD RECEIVED THOSE DIVIDENDS AND BY THAT MUCHHAD PROFITED BY JACKSON S BLOOD  IF ONE MAN COULD BE SO MONSTROUSLYTREATED AND SOCIETY MOVE ON ITS WAY UNHEEDING  MIGHT NOT MANY MEN BE SOMONSTROUSLY TREATED  I REMEMBERED ERNEST S WOMEN OF CHICAGO WHO TOILEDFOR NINETY CENTS A WEEK  AND THE CHILD SLAVES OF THE SOUTHERN COTTONMILLS HE HAD DESCRIBED  AND I COULD SEE THEIR WAN WHITE HANDS  FROMWHICH THE BLOOD HAD BEEN PRESSED  AT WORK UPON THE CLOTH OUT OF WHICHHAD BEEN MADE MY GOWN  AND THEN I THOUGHT OF THE SIERRA MILLS AND THEDIVIDENDS THAT HAD BEEN PAID  AND I SAW THE BLOOD OF JACKSON UPON MYGOWN AS WELL  JACKSON I COULD NOT ESCAPE  ALWAYS MY MEDITATIONS LED MEBACK TO HIM DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF ME I HAD A FEELING THAT I STOOD ON THE EDGE OFA PRECIPICE  IT WAS AS THOUGH I WERE ABOUT TO SEE A NEW AND AWFULREVELATION OF LIFE  AND NOT I ALONE  MY WHOLE WORLD WAS TURNING OVER THERE WAS MY FATHER  I COULD SEE THE EFFECT ERNEST WAS BEGINNING TO HAVEON HIM  AND THEN THERE WAS THE BISHOP  WHEN I HAD LAST SEEN HIM HE HADLOOKED A SICK MAN  HE WAS AT HIGH NERVOUS TENSION  AND IN HIS EYES THEREWAS UNSPEAKABLE HORROR  FROM THE LITTLE I LEARNED I KNEW THAT ERNEST HADBEEN KEEPING HIS PROMISE OF TAKING HIM THROUGH HELL  BUT WHAT SCENES OFHELL THE BISHOP S EYES HAD SEEN  I KNEW NOT  FOR HE SEEMED TOO STUNNEDTO SPEAK ABOUT THEM ONCE  THE FEELING STRONG UPON ME THAT MY LITTLE WORLD AND ALL THE WORLDWAS TURNING OVER  I THOUGHT OF ERNEST AS THE CAUSE OF IT  AND ALSO ITHOUGHT   WE WERE SO HAPPY AND PEACEFUL BEFORE HE CAME   AND THE NEXTMOMENT I WAS AWARE THAT THE THOUGHT WAS A TREASON AGAINST TRUTH  ANDERNEST ROSE BEFORE ME TRANSFIGURED  THE APOSTLE OF TRUTH  WITH SHININGBROWS AND THE FEARLESSNESS OF ONE OF GODS OWN ANGELS  BATTLING FOR THETRUTH AND THE RIGHT  AND BATTLING FOR THE SUCCOR OF THE POOR AND LONELYAND OPPRESSED  AND THEN THERE AROSE BEFORE ME ANOTHER FIGURE  THECHRIST  HE  TOO  HAD TAKEN THE PART OF THE LOWLY AND OPPRESSED AND AGAINST ALL THE ESTABLISHED POWER OF PRIEST AND PHARISEE  AND IREMEMBERED HIS END UPON THE CROSS  AND MY HEART CONTRACTED WITH A PANGAS I THOUGHT OF ERNEST  WAS HE  TOO  DESTINED FOR A CROSS   HE  WITH HISCLARION CALL AND WAR NOTED VOICE  AND ALL THE FINE MAN S VIGOR OF HIM AND IN THAT MOMENT I KNEW THAT I LOVED HIM  AND THAT I WAS MELTINGWITH DESIRE TO COMFORT HIM  I THOUGHT OF HIS LIFE  A SORDID  HARSH  ANDMEAGRE LIFE IT MUST HAVE BEEN  AND I THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER  WHO HAD LIEDAND STOLEN FOR HIM AND BEEN WORKED TO DEATH  AND HE HIMSELF HAD GONEINTO THE MILLS WHEN HE WAS TEN  ALL MY HEART SEEMED BURSTING WITH DESIRETO FOLD MY ARMS AROUND HIM  AND TO REST HIS HEAD ON MY BREAST  HIS HEADTHAT MUST BE WEARY WITH SO MANY THOUGHTS  AND TO GIVE HIM REST  JUSTREST  AND EASEMENT AND FORGETFULNESS FOR A TENDER SPACE I MET COLONEL INGRAM AT A CHURCH RECEPTION  HIM I KNEW WELL AND HADKNOWN WELL FOR MANY YEARS  I TRAPPED HIM BEHIND LARGE PALMS AND RUBBERPLANTS  THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS TRAPPED  HE MET ME WITH THECONVENTIONAL GAYETY AND GALLANTRY  HE WAS EVER A GRACEFUL MAN DIPLOMATIC  TACTFUL  AND CONSIDERATE  AND AS FOR APPEARANCE  HE WASTHE MOST DISTINGUISHED LOOKING MAN IN OUR SOCIETY  BESIDE HIM EVEN THEVENERABLE HEAD OF THE UNIVERSITY LOOKED TAWDRY AND SMALL AND YET I FOUND COLONEL INGRAM SITUATED THE SAME AS THE UNLETTEREDMECHANICS  HE WAS NOT A FREE AGENT  HE  TOO  WAS BOUND UPON THE WHEEL I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE CHANGE IN HIM WHEN I MENTIONED JACKSON S CASE HIS SMILING GOOD NATURE VANISHED LIKE A GHOST  A SUDDEN  FRIGHTFULEXPRESSION DISTORTED HIS WELL BRED FACE  I FELT THE SAME ALARM THAT IHAD FELT WHEN JAMES SMITH BROKE OUT  BUT COLONEL INGRAM DID NOT CURSE THAT WAS THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCE THAT WAS LEFT BETWEEN THE WORKINGMAN ANDHIM  HE WAS FAMED AS A WIT  BUT HE HAD NO WIT NOW  AND  UNCONSCIOUSLY THIS WAY AND THAT HE GLANCED FOR AVENUES OF ESCAPE  BUT HE WAS TRAPPEDAMID THE PALMS AND RUBBER TREES OH  HE WAS SICK OF THE SOUND OF JACKSON S NAME  WHY HAD I BROUGHT THEMATTER UP  HE DID NOT RELISH MY JOKE  IT WAS POOR TASTE ON MY PART AND VERY INCONSIDERATE  DID I NOT KNOW THAT IN HIS PROFESSION PERSONALFEELINGS DID NOT COUNT  HE LEFT HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS AT HOME WHENHE WENT DOWN TO THE OFFICE  AT THE OFFICE HE HAD ONLY PROFESSIONALFEELINGS  SHOULD JACKSON HAVE RECEIVED DAMAGES   I ASKED  CERTAINLY   HE ANSWERED   THAT IS  PERSONALLY  I HAVE A FEELING THAT HESHOULD  BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE CASE  HE WAS GETTING HIS SCATTERED WITS SLIGHTLY IN HAND  TELL ME  HAS RIGHT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LAW   I ASKED  YOU HAVE USED THE WRONG INITIAL CONSONANT   HE SMILED IN ANSWER  MIGHT   I QUERIED  AND HE NODDED HIS HEAD   AND YET WE ARE SUPPOSED TOGET JUSTICE BY MEANS OF THE LAW   THAT IS THE PARADOX OF IT   HE COUNTERED   WE DO GET JUSTICE   YOU ARE SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY NOW  ARE YOU NOT   I ASKED COLONEL INGRAM BLUSHED  ACTUALLY BLUSHED  AND AGAIN HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLYABOUT HIM FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE  BUT I BLOCKED HIS PATH AND DID NOT OFFERTO MOVE  TELL ME   I SAID   WHEN ONE SURRENDERS HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS TO HISPROFESSIONAL FEELINGS  MAY NOT THE ACTION BE DEFINED AS A SORT OFSPIRITUAL MAYHEM  I DID NOT GET AN ANSWER  COLONEL INGRAM HAD INGLORIOUSLY BOLTED OVERTURNING A PALM IN HIS FLIGHT NEXT I TRIED THE NEWSPAPERS  I WROTE A QUIET  RESTRAINED  DISPASSIONATEACCOUNT OF JACKSON S CASE  I MADE NO CHARGES AGAINST THE MEN WITH WHOMI HAD TALKED  NOR  FOR THAT MATTER  DID I EVEN MENTION THEM  I GAVETHE ACTUAL FACTS OF THE CASE  THE LONG YEARS JACKSON HAD WORKED IN THEMILLS  HIS EFFORT TO SAVE THE MACHINERY FROM DAMAGE AND THE CONSEQUENTACCIDENT  AND HIS OWN PRESENT WRETCHED AND STARVING CONDITION  THETHREE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS REJECTED MY COMMUNICATION  LIKEWISE DID THE TWOWEEKLIES I GOT HOLD OF PERCY LAYTON  HE WAS A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY  HADGONE IN FOR JOURNALISM  AND WAS THEN SERVING HIS APPRENTICESHIP ASREPORTER ON THE MOST INFLUENTIAL OF THE THREE NEWSPAPERS  HE SMILED WHENI ASKED HIM THE REASON THE NEWSPAPERS SUPPRESSED ALL MENTION OF JACKSONOR HIS CASE  EDITORIAL POLICY   HE SAID   WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT  IT S UPTO THE EDITORS   BUT WHY IS IT POLICY   I ASKED  WE RE ALL SOLID WITH THE CORPORATIONS   HE ANSWERED   IF YOU PAIDADVERTISING RATES  YOU COULDN T GET ANY SUCH MATTER INTO THE PAPERS  AMAN WHO TRIED TO SMUGGLE IT IN WOULD LOSE HIS JOB  YOU COULDN T GET ITIN IF YOU PAID TEN TIMES THE REGULAR ADVERTISING RATES   HOW ABOUT YOUR OWN POLICY   I QUESTIONED   IT WOULD SEEM YOUR FUNCTIONIS TO TWIST TRUTH AT THE COMMAND OF YOUR EMPLOYERS  WHO  IN TURN  OBEYTHE BEHESTS OF THE CORPORATIONS   I HAVEN T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT   HE LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THEMOMENT  THEN BRIGHTENED AS HE SAW HIS WAY OUT   I  MYSELF  DO NOT WRITEUNTRUTHFUL THINGS  I KEEP SQUARE ALL RIGHT WITH MY OWN CONSCIENCE  OFCOURSE  THERE S LOTS THAT S REPUGNANT IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY S WORK BUT THEN  YOU SEE  THAT S ALL PART OF THE DAY S WORK   HE WOUND UPBOYISHLY  YET YOU EXPECT TO SIT AT AN EDITOR S DESK SOME DAY AND CONDUCT APOLICY   I LL BE CASE HARDENED BY THAT TIME   WAS HIS REPLY  SINCE YOU ARE NOT YET CASE HARDENED  TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK RIGHT NOWABOUT THE GENERAL EDITORIAL POLICY   I DON T THINK   HE ANSWERED QUICKLY   ONE CAN T KICK OVER THE ROPESIF HE S GOING TO SUCCEED IN JOURNALISM  I VE LEARNED THAT MUCH  AT ANYRATE  AND HE NODDED HIS YOUNG HEAD SAGELY  BUT THE RIGHT   I PERSISTED  YOU DON T UNDERSTAND THE GAME  OF COURSE IT S ALL RIGHT  BECAUSE ITCOMES OUT ALL RIGHT  DON T YOU SEE   DELIGHTFULLY VAGUE   I MURMURED  BUT MY HEART WAS ACHING FOR THE YOUTHOF HIM  AND I FELT THAT I MUST EITHER SCREAM OR BURST INTO TEARS I WAS BEGINNING TO SEE THROUGH THE APPEARANCES OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH IHAD ALWAYS LIVED  AND TO FIND THE FRIGHTFUL REALITIES THAT WERE BENEATH THERE SEEMED A TACIT CONSPIRACY AGAINST JACKSON  AND I WAS AWARE OF ATHRILL OF SYMPATHY FOR THE WHINING LAWYER WHO HAD INGLORIOUSLY FOUGHTHIS CASE  BUT THIS TACIT CONSPIRACY GREW LARGE  NOT ALONE WAS IT AIMEDAGAINST JACKSON  IT WAS AIMED AGAINST EVERY WORKINGMAN WHO WAS MAIMED INTHE MILLS  AND IF AGAINST EVERY MAN IN THE MILLS  WHY NOT AGAINST EVERYMAN IN ALL THE OTHER MILLS AND FACTORIES  IN FACT  WAS IT NOT TRUE OFALL THE INDUSTRIES AND IF THIS WAS SO  THEN SOCIETY WAS A LIE  I SHRANK BACK FROM MY OWNCONCLUSIONS  IT WAS TOO TERRIBLE AND AWFUL TO BE TRUE  BUT THERE WASJACKSON  AND JACKSON S ARM  AND THE BLOOD THAT STAINED MY GOWN ANDDRIPPED FROM MY OWN ROOF BEAMS  AND THERE WERE MANY JACKSONS  HUNDREDSOF THEM IN THE MILLS ALONE  AS JACKSON HIMSELF HAD SAID  JACKSON I COULDNOT ESCAPE I SAW MR  WICKSON AND MR  PERTONWAITHE  THE TWO MEN WHO HELD MOST OF THESTOCK IN THE SIERRA MILLS  BUT I COULD NOT SHAKE THEM AS I HAD SHAKENTHE MECHANICS IN THEIR EMPLOY  I DISCOVERED THAT THEY HAD AN ETHICSUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE REST OF SOCIETY  IT WAS WHAT I MAY CALL THEARISTOCRATIC ETHIC OR THE MASTER ETHIC   THEY TALKED IN LARGE WAYS OFPOLICY  AND THEY IDENTIFIED POLICY AND RIGHT  AND TO ME THEY TALKED INFATHERLY WAYS  PATRONIZING MY YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE  THEY WERE THE MOSTHOPELESS OF ALL I HAD ENCOUNTERED IN MY QUEST  THEY BELIEVED ABSOLUTELYTHAT THEIR CONDUCT WAS RIGHT  THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT  NODISCUSSION  THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE THE SAVIOURS OF SOCIETY AND THAT IT WAS THEY WHO MADE HAPPINESS FOR THE MANY  AND THEY DREWPATHETIC PICTURES OF WHAT WOULD BE THE SUFFERINGS OF THE WORKING CLASSWERE IT NOT FOR THE EMPLOYMENT THAT THEY  AND THEY ALONE  BY THEIRWISDOM  PROVIDED FOR IT        BEFORE AVIS EVERHARD WAS BORN  JOHN STUART MILL  IN HIS     ESSAY  ON LIBERTY  WROTE   WHEREVER THERE IS AN ASCENDANT     CLASS  A LARGE PORTION OF THE MORALITY EMANATES FROM ITS     CLASS INTERESTS AND ITS CLASS FEELINGS OF SUPERIORITY  FRESH FROM THESE TWO MASTERS  I MET ERNEST AND RELATED MY EXPERIENCE  HELOOKED AT ME WITH A PLEASED EXPRESSION  AND SAID  REALLY  THIS IS FINE  YOU ARE BEGINNING TO DIG TRUTH FOR YOURSELF  ITIS YOUR OWN EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATION  AND IT IS CORRECT  NO MAN IN THEINDUSTRIAL MACHINE IS A FREE WILL AGENT  EXCEPT THE LARGE CAPITALIST AND HE ISN T  IF YOU LL PARDON THE IRISHISM   YOU SEE  THE MASTERSARE QUITE SURE THAT THEY ARE RIGHT IN WHAT THEY ARE DOING  THAT IS THECROWNING ABSURDITY OF THE WHOLE SITUATION  THEY ARE SO TIED BY THEIRHUMAN NATURE THAT THEY CAN T DO A THING UNLESS THEY THINK IT IS RIGHT THEY MUST HAVE A SANCTION FOR THEIR ACTS        VERBAL CONTRADICTIONS  CALLED BULLS  WERE LONG AN AMIABLE     WEAKNESS OF THE ANCIENT IRISH  WHEN THEY WANT TO DO A THING  IN BUSINESS OF COURSE  THEY MUST WAITTILL THERE ARISES IN THEIR BRAINS  SOMEHOW  A RELIGIOUS  OR ETHICAL  ORSCIENTIFIC  OR PHILOSOPHIC  CONCEPT THAT THE THING IS RIGHT  AND THENTHEY GO AHEAD AND DO IT  UNWITTING THAT ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES OF THEHUMAN MIND IS THAT THE WISH IS PARENT TO THE THOUGHT  NO MATTER WHATTHEY WANT TO DO  THE SANCTION ALWAYS COMES  THEY ARE SUPERFICIALCASUISTS  THEY ARE JESUITICAL  THEY EVEN SEE THEIR WAY TO DOING WRONGTHAT RIGHT MAY COME OF IT  ONE OF THE PLEASANT AND AXIOMATIC FICTIONSTHEY HAVE CREATED IS THAT THEY ARE SUPERIOR TO THE REST OF MANKIND INWISDOM AND EFFICIENCY  THEREFROM COMES THEIR SANCTION TO MANAGE THEBREAD AND BUTTER OF THE REST OF MANKIND  THEY HAVE EVEN RESURRECTED THETHEORY OF THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS  COMMERCIAL KINGS IN THEIR CASE         THE NEWSPAPERS  IN      OF THAT ERA  CREDITED THE     PRESIDENT OF THE ANTHRACITE COAL TRUST  GEORGE F  BAER  WITH     THE ENUNCIATION OF THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLE   THE RIGHTS AND     INTERESTS OF THE LABORING MAN WILL BE PROTECTED BY THE     CHRISTIAN MEN TO WHOM GOD IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM HAS GIVEN     THE PROPERTY INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY   THE WEAKNESS IN THEIR POSITION LIES IN THAT THEY ARE MERELYBUSINESS MEN  THEY ARE NOT PHILOSOPHERS  THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NORSOCIOLOGISTS  IF THEY WERE  OF COURSE ALL WOULD BE WELL  A BUSINESS MANWHO WAS ALSO A BIOLOGIST AND A SOCIOLOGIST WOULD KNOW  APPROXIMATELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR HUMANITY  BUT  OUTSIDE THE REALM OF BUSINESS THESE MEN ARE STUPID  THEY KNOW ONLY BUSINESS  THEY DO NOT KNOW MANKINDNOR SOCIETY  AND YET THEY SET THEMSELVES UP AS ARBITERS OF THE FATES OFTHE HUNGRY MILLIONS AND ALL THE OTHER MILLIONS THROWN IN  HISTORY  SOMEDAY  WILL HAVE AN EXCRUCIATING LAUGH AT THEIR EXPENSE  I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN I HAD MY TALK OUT WITH MRS  WICKSON AND MRS PERTONWAITHE  THEY WERE SOCIETY WOMEN   THEIR HOMES WERE PALACES  THEYHAD MANY HOMES SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY  IN THE MOUNTAINS  ON LAKES AND BY THE SEA  THEY WERE TENDED BY ARMIES OF SERVANTS  AND THEIR SOCIALACTIVITIES WERE BEWILDERING  THEY PATRONIZED THE UNIVERSITY AND THECHURCHES  AND THE PASTORS ESPECIALLY BOWED AT THEIR KNEES IN MEEKSUBSERVIENCE    THEY WERE POWERS  THESE TWO WOMEN  WHAT OF THE MONEYTHAT WAS THEIRS  THE POWER OF SUBSIDIZATION OF THOUGHT WAS THEIRS TO AREMARKABLE DEGREE  AS I WAS SOON TO LEARN UNDER ERNEST S TUITION        SOCIETY IS HERE USED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE  A COMMON USAGE     OF THE TIMES TO DENOTE THE GILDED DRONES THAT DID NO LABOR      BUT ONLY GLUTTED THEMSELVES AT THE HONEY VATS OF THE     WORKERS   NEITHER THE BUSINESS MEN NOR THE LABORERS HAD TIME     OR OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIETY  SOCIETY WAS THE CREATION OF THE     IDLE RICH WHO TOILED NOT AND WHO IN THIS WAY PLAYED          BRING ON YOUR TAINTED MONEY   WAS THE EXPRESSED     SENTIMENT OF THE CHURCH DURING THIS PERIOD THEY APED THEIR HUSBANDS  AND TALKED IN THE SAME LARGE WAYS ABOUTPOLICY  AND THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE RICH  THEY WERESWAYED BY THE SAME ETHIC THAT DOMINATED THEIR HUSBANDS  THE ETHIC OFTHEIR CLASS  AND THEY UTTERED GLIB PHRASES THAT THEIR OWN EARS DID NOTUNDERSTAND ALSO  THEY GREW IRRITATED WHEN I TOLD THEM OF THE DEPLORABLE CONDITIONOF JACKSON S FAMILY  AND WHEN I WONDERED THAT THEY HAD MADE NOVOLUNTARY PROVISION FOR THE MAN  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY THANKED NO ONEFOR INSTRUCTING THEM IN THEIR SOCIAL DUTIES  WHEN I ASKED THEM FLATLYTO ASSIST JACKSON  THEY AS FLATLY REFUSED  THE ASTOUNDING THING ABOUT ITWAS THAT THEY REFUSED IN ALMOST IDENTICALLY THE SAME LANGUAGE  AND THISIN FACE OF THE FACT THAT I INTERVIEWED THEM SEPARATELY AND THAT ONE DIDNOT KNOW THAT I HAD SEEN OR WAS GOING TO SEE THE OTHER  THEIR COMMONREPLY WAS THAT THEY WERE GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT PERFECTLYPLAIN THAT NO PREMIUM WOULD EVER BE PUT ON CARELESSNESS BY THEM  NORWOULD THEY  BY PAYING FOR ACCIDENT  TEMPT THE POOR TO HURT THEMSELVES INTHE MACHINERY         IN THE FILES OF THE OUTLOOK  A CRITICAL WEEKLY OF THE     PERIOD  IN THE NUMBER DATED AUGUST           IS RELATED THE     CIRCUMSTANCE OF A WORKINGMAN LOSING HIS ARM  THE DETAILS OF     WHICH ARE QUITE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF JACKSON S CASE AS     RELATED BY AVIS EVERHARD AND THEY WERE SINCERE  THESE TWO WOMEN  THEY WERE DRUNK WITH CONVICTIONOF THE SUPERIORITY OF THEIR CLASS AND OF THEMSELVES  THEY HAD ASANCTION  IN THEIR OWN CLASS ETHIC  FOR EVERY ACT THEY PERFORMED  AS IDROVE AWAY FROM MRS  PERTONWAITHE S GREAT HOUSE  I LOOKED BACK ATIT  AND I REMEMBERED ERNEST S EXPRESSION THAT THEY WERE BOUND TO THEMACHINE  BUT THAT THEY WERE SO BOUND THAT THEY SAT ON TOP OF IT CHAPTER VTHE PHILOMATHSERNEST WAS OFTEN AT THE HOUSE  NOR WAS IT MY FATHER  MERELY  NORTHE CONTROVERSIAL DINNERS  THAT DREW HIM THERE  EVEN AT THAT TIME IFLATTERED MYSELF THAT I PLAYED SOME PART IN CAUSING HIS VISITS  AND ITWAS NOT LONG BEFORE I LEARNED THE CORRECTNESS OF MY SURMISE  FOR NEVERWAS THERE SUCH A LOVER AS ERNEST EVERHARD  HIS GAZE AND HIS HAND CLASPGREW FIRMER AND STEADIER  IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE  AND THE QUESTION THATHAD GROWN FROM THE FIRST IN HIS EYES  GREW ONLY THE MORE IMPERATIVE MY IMPRESSION OF HIM  THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM  HAD BEEN UNFAVORABLE THEN I HAD FOUND MYSELF ATTRACTED TOWARD HIM  NEXT CAME MY REPULSION WHEN HE SO SAVAGELY ATTACKED MY CLASS AND ME  AFTER THAT  AS I SAW THATHE HAD NOT MALIGNED MY CLASS  AND THAT THE HARSH AND BITTER THINGS HESAID ABOUT IT WERE JUSTIFIED  I HAD DRAWN CLOSER TO HIM AGAIN  HE BECAMEMY ORACLE  FOR ME HE TORE THE SHAM FROM THE FACE OF SOCIETY AND GAVEME GLIMPSES OF REALITY THAT WERE AS UNPLEASANT AS THEY WERE UNDENIABLYTRUE AS I HAVE SAID  THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A LOVER AS HE  NO GIRL COULDLIVE IN A UNIVERSITY TOWN TILL SHE WAS TWENTY FOUR AND NOT HAVE LOVEEXPERIENCES  I HAD BEEN MADE LOVE TO BY BEARDLESS SOPHOMORES AND GRAYPROFESSORS  AND BY THE ATHLETES AND THE FOOTBALL GIANTS  BUT NOT ONEOF THEM MADE LOVE TO ME AS ERNEST DID  HIS ARMS WERE AROUND ME BEFORE IKNEW  HIS LIPS WERE ON MINE BEFORE I COULD PROTEST OR RESIST  BEFORE HISEARNESTNESS CONVENTIONAL MAIDEN DIGNITY WAS RIDICULOUS  HE SWEPT ME OFFMY FEET BY THE SPLENDID INVINCIBLE RUSH OF HIM  HE DID NOT PROPOSE  HEPUT HIS ARMS AROUND ME AND KISSED ME AND TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THATWE SHOULD BE MARRIED  THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION ABOUT IT  THE ONLYDISCUSSION  AND THAT AROSE AFTERWARD  WAS WHEN WE SHOULD BE MARRIED IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED  IT WAS UNREAL  YET  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST STEST OF TRUTH  IT WORKED  I TRUSTED MY LIFE TO IT  AND FORTUNATE WAS THETRUST  YET DURING THOSE FIRST DAYS OF OUR LOVE  FEAR OF THE FUTURECAME OFTEN TO ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE VIOLENCE AND IMPETUOSITY OF HISLOVE MAKING  YET SUCH FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS  NO WOMAN WAS EVER BLESSEDWITH A GENTLER  TENDERER HUSBAND  THIS GENTLENESS AND VIOLENCE ONHIS PART WAS A CURIOUS BLEND SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN HIS CARRIAGE OFAWKWARDNESS AND EASE  THAT SLIGHT AWKWARDNESS  HE NEVER GOT OVER IT AND IT WAS DELICIOUS  HIS BEHAVIOR IN OUR DRAWING ROOM REMINDED ME OF ACAREFUL BULL IN A CHINA SHOP         IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS STILL THE CUSTOM TO FILL THE LIVING     ROOMS WITH BRIC A BRAC   THEY HAD NOT DISCOVERED SIMPLICITY     OF LIVING  SUCH ROOMS WERE MUSEUMS  ENTAILING ENDLESS LABOR     TO KEEP CLEAN  THE DUST DEMON WAS THE LORD OF THE HOUSEHOLD      THERE WERE A MYRIAD DEVICES FOR CATCHING DUST  AND ONLY A     FEW DEVICES FOR GETTING RID OF IT IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT VANISHED MY LAST DOUBT OF THE COMPLETENESS OFMY LOVE FOR HIM  A SUBCONSCIOUS DOUBT  AT MOST   IT WAS AT THE PHILOMATHCLUB  A WONDERFUL NIGHT OF BATTLE  WHEREIN ERNEST BEARDED THE MASTERSIN THEIR LAIR  NOW THE PHILOMATH CLUB WAS THE MOST SELECT ON THE PACIFICCOAST  IT WAS THE CREATION OF MISS BRENTWOOD  AN ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY OLDMAID  AND IT WAS HER HUSBAND  AND FAMILY  AND TOY  ITS MEMBERS WERE THEWEALTHIEST IN THE COMMUNITY  AND THE STRONGEST MINDED OF THE WEALTHY WITH  OF COURSE  A SPRINKLING OF SCHOLARS TO GIVE IT INTELLECTUAL TONE THE PHILOMATH HAD NO CLUB HOUSE  IT WAS NOT THAT KIND OF A CLUB  ONCE AMONTH ITS MEMBERS GATHERED AT SOME ONE OF THEIR PRIVATE HOUSES TO LISTENTO A LECTURE  THE LECTURERS WERE USUALLY  THOUGH NOT ALWAYS  HIRED  IF ACHEMIST IN NEW YORK MADE A NEW DISCOVERY IN SAY RADIUM  ALL HIS EXPENSESACROSS THE CONTINENT WERE PAID  AND AS WELL HE RECEIVED A PRINCELY FEEFOR HIS TIME  THE SAME WITH A RETURNING EXPLORER FROM THE POLAR REGIONS OR THE LATEST LITERARY OR ARTISTIC SUCCESS  NO VISITORS WERE ALLOWED WHILE IT WAS THE PHILOMATH S POLICY TO PERMIT NONE OF ITS DISCUSSIONSTO GET INTO THE PAPERS  THUS GREAT STATESMEN  AND THERE HAD BEEN SUCHOCCASIONS  WERE ABLE FULLY TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS I SPREAD BEFORE ME A WRINKLED LETTER  WRITTEN TO ME BY ERNEST TWENTYYEARS AGO  AND FROM IT I COPY THE FOLLOWING  YOUR FATHER IS A MEMBER OF THE PHILOMATH  SO YOU ARE ABLE TO COME THEREFORE COME NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT  I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL HAVE THETIME OF YOUR LIFE  IN YOUR RECENT ENCOUNTERS  YOU FAILED TO SHAKE THEMASTERS  IF YOU COME  I LL SHAKE THEM FOR YOU  I LL MAKE THEM SNARL LIKEWOLVES  YOU MERELY QUESTIONED THEIR MORALITY  WHEN THEIR MORALITY ISQUESTIONED  THEY GROW ONLY THE MORE COMPLACENT AND SUPERIOR  BUT I SHALLMENACE THEIR MONEY BAGS  THAT WILL SHAKE THEM TO THE ROOTS OF THEIRPRIMITIVE NATURES  IF YOU CAN COME  YOU WILL SEE THE CAVE MAN  INEVENING DRESS  SNARLING AND SNAPPING OVER A BONE  I PROMISE YOU A GREATCATERWAULING AND AN ILLUMINATING INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THE BEAST  THEY VE INVITED ME IN ORDER TO TEAR ME TO PIECES  THIS IS THE IDEA OFMISS BRENTWOOD  SHE CLUMSILY HINTED AS MUCH WHEN SHE INVITED ME SHE S GIVEN THEM THAT KIND OF FUN BEFORE  THEY DELIGHT IN GETTINGTRUSTFUL SOULED GENTLE REFORMERS BEFORE THEM  MISS BRENTWOOD THINKS IAM AS MILD AS A KITTEN AND AS GOOD NATURED AND STOLID AS THE FAMILY COW I LL NOT DENY THAT I HELPED TO GIVE HER THAT IMPRESSION  SHE WAS VERYTENTATIVE AT FIRST  UNTIL SHE DIVINED MY HARMLESSNESS  I AM TO RECEIVEA HANDSOME FEE  TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS  AS BEFITS THE MAN WHO THOUGH A RADICAL  ONCE RAN FOR GOVERNOR  ALSO  I AM TO WEAR EVENINGDRESS  THIS IS COMPULSORY  I NEVER WAS SO APPARELLED IN MY LIFE  ISUPPOSE I LL HAVE TO HIRE ONE SOMEWHERE  BUT I D DO MORE THAN THAT TOGET A CHANCE AT THE PHILOMATHS  OF ALL PLACES  THE CLUB GATHERED THAT NIGHT AT THE PERTONWAITHE HOUSE EXTRA CHAIRS HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM  AND INALL THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED PHILOMATHS THAT SAT DOWN TO HEARERNEST  THEY WERE TRULY LORDS OF SOCIETY  I AMUSED MYSELF WITH RUNNINGOVER IN MY MIND THE SUM OF THE FORTUNES REPRESENTED  AND IT RAN WELLINTO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS  AND THE POSSESSORS WERE NOT OF THE IDLERICH  THEY WERE MEN OF AFFAIRS WHO TOOK MOST ACTIVE PARTS IN INDUSTRIALAND POLITICAL LIFE WE WERE ALL SEATED WHEN MISS BRENTWOOD BROUGHT ERNEST IN  THEY MOVEDAT ONCE TO THE HEAD OF THE ROOM  FROM WHERE HE WAS TO SPEAK  HE WASIN EVENING DRESS  AND  WHAT OF HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND KINGLY HEAD  HELOOKED MAGNIFICENT  AND THEN THERE WAS THAT FAINT AND UNMISTAKABLE TOUCHOF AWKWARDNESS IN HIS MOVEMENTS  I ALMOST THINK I COULD HAVE LOVED HIMFOR THAT ALONE  AND AS I LOOKED AT HIM I WAS AWARE OF A GREAT JOY  IFELT AGAIN THE PULSE OF HIS PALM ON MINE  THE TOUCH OF HIS LIPS  ANDSUCH PRIDE WAS MINE THAT I FELT I MUST RISE UP AND CRY OUT TO THEASSEMBLED COMPANY   HE IS MINE  HE HAS HELD ME IN HIS ARMS  AND I MERE I  HAVE FILLED THAT MIND OF HIS TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL HISMULTITUDINOUS AND KINGLY THOUGHTS  AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM  MISS BRENTWOOD INTRODUCED HIM TO COLONEL VANGILBERT  AND I KNEW THAT THE LATTER WAS TO PRESIDE  COLONEL VAN GILBERTWAS A GREAT CORPORATION LAWYER  IN ADDITION  HE WAS IMMENSELY WEALTHY THE SMALLEST FEE HE WOULD DEIGN TO NOTICE WAS A HUNDRED THOUSANDDOLLARS  HE WAS A MASTER OF LAW  THE LAW WAS A PUPPET WITH WHICH HEPLAYED  HE MOULDED IT LIKE CLAY  TWISTED AND DISTORTED IT LIKE A CHINESEPUZZLE INTO ANY DESIGN HE CHOSE  IN APPEARANCE AND RHETORIC HE WASOLD FASHIONED  BUT IN IMAGINATION AND KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCE HE WAS ASYOUNG AS THE LATEST STATUTE  HIS FIRST PROMINENCE HAD COME WHEN HE BROKETHE SHARDWELL WILL   HIS FEE FOR THIS ONE ACT WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSANDDOLLARS  FROM THEN ON HE HAD RISEN LIKE A ROCKET  HE WAS OFTEN CALLEDTHE GREATEST LAWYER IN THE COUNTRY  CORPORATION LAWYER  OF COURSE  ANDNO CLASSIFICATION OF THE THREE GREATEST LAWYERS IN THE UNITED STATESCOULD HAVE EXCLUDED HIM        THIS BREAKING OF WILLS WAS A PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE     PERIOD  WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF VAST FORTUNES  THE PROBLEM     OF DISPOSING OF THESE FORTUNES AFTER DEATH WAS A VEXING ONE     TO THE ACCUMULATORS  WILL MAKING AND WILL BREAKING BECAME     COMPLEMENTARY TRADES  LIKE ARMOR MAKING AND GUN MAKING   THE     SHREWDEST WILL MAKING LAWYERS WERE CALLED IN TO MAKE WILLS     THAT COULD NOT BE BROKEN   BUT THESE WILLS WERE ALWAYS     BROKEN  AND VERY OFTEN BY THE VERY LAWYERS THAT HAD DRAWN     THEM UP   NEVERTHELESS THE DELUSION PERSISTED IN THE WEALTHY     CLASS THAT AN ABSOLUTELY UNBREAKABLE WILL COULD BE CAST  AND     SO  THROUGH THE GENERATIONS  CLIENTS AND LAWYERS PURSUED THE     ILLUSION   IT WAS A PURSUIT LIKE UNTO THAT OF THE UNIVERSAL     SOLVENT OF THE MEDIAEVAL ALCHEMISTS HE AROSE AND BEGAN  IN A FEW WELL CHOSEN PHRASES THAT CARRIED ANUNDERTONE OF FAINT IRONY  TO INTRODUCE ERNEST  COLONEL VAN GILBERT WASSUBTLY FACETIOUS IN HIS INTRODUCTION OF THE SOCIAL REFORMER AND MEMBEROF THE WORKING CLASS  AND THE AUDIENCE SMILED  IT MADE ME ANGRY  ANDI GLANCED AT ERNEST  THE SIGHT OF HIM MADE ME DOUBLY ANGRY  HE DID NOTSEEM TO RESENT THE DELICATE SLURS  WORSE THAN THAT  HE DID NOT SEEM TOBE AWARE OF THEM  THERE HE SAT  GENTLE  AND STOLID  AND SOMNOLENT  HEREALLY LOOKED STUPID  AND FOR A MOMENT THE THOUGHT ROSE IN MY MIND  WHATIF HE WERE OVERAWED BY THIS IMPOSING ARRAY OF POWER AND BRAINS  THEN ISMILED  HE COULDN T FOOL ME  BUT HE FOOLED THE OTHERS  JUST AS HE HADFOOLED MISS BRENTWOOD  SHE OCCUPIED A CHAIR RIGHT UP TO THE FRONT  ANDSEVERAL TIMES SHE TURNED HER HEAD TOWARD ONE OR ANOTHER OF HER CONFRERESAND SMILED HER APPRECIATION OF THE REMARKS COLONEL VAN GILBERT DONE  ERNEST AROSE AND BEGAN TO SPEAK  HE BEGAN INA LOW VOICE  HALTINGLY AND MODESTLY  AND WITH AN AIR OF EVIDENTEMBARRASSMENT  HE SPOKE OF HIS BIRTH IN THE WORKING CLASS  AND OF THESORDIDNESS AND WRETCHEDNESS OF HIS ENVIRONMENT  WHERE FLESH AND SPIRITWERE ALIKE STARVED AND TORMENTED  HE DESCRIBED HIS AMBITIONS AND IDEALS AND HIS CONCEPTION OF THE PARADISE WHEREIN LIVED THE PEOPLE OF THE UPPERCLASSES  AS HE SAID  UP ABOVE ME  I KNEW  WERE UNSELFISHNESSES OF THE SPIRIT  CLEAN ANDNOBLE THINKING  KEEN INTELLECTUAL LIVING  I KNEW ALL THIS BECAUSE I READ SEASIDE LIBRARY   NOVELS  IN WHICH  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VILLAINSAND ADVENTURESSES  ALL MEN AND WOMEN THOUGHT BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS  SPOKE ABEAUTIFUL TONGUE  AND PERFORMED GLORIOUS DEEDS  IN SHORT  AS I ACCEPTEDTHE RISING OF THE SUN  I ACCEPTED THAT UP ABOVE ME WAS ALL THAT WAS FINEAND NOBLE AND GRACIOUS  ALL THAT GAVE DECENCY AND DIGNITY TO LIFE  ALLTHAT MADE LIFE WORTH LIVING AND THAT REMUNERATED ONE FOR HIS TRAVAIL ANDMISERY         A CURIOUS AND AMAZING LITERATURE THAT SERVED TO MAKE THE     WORKING CLASS UTTERLY MISAPPREHEND THE NATURE OF THE LEISURE     CLASS HE WENT ON AND TRACED HIS LIFE IN THE MILLS  THE LEARNING OF THEHORSESHOEING TRADE  AND HIS MEETING WITH THE SOCIALISTS  AMONG THEM  HESAID  HE HAD FOUND KEEN INTELLECTS AND BRILLIANT WITS  MINISTERS OF THEGOSPEL WHO HAD BEEN BROKEN BECAUSE THEIR CHRISTIANITY WAS TOO WIDE FORANY CONGREGATION OF MAMMON WORSHIPPERS  AND PROFESSORS WHO HAD BEENBROKEN ON THE WHEEL OF UNIVERSITY SUBSERVIENCE TO THE RULING CLASS  THESOCIALISTS WERE REVOLUTIONISTS  HE SAID  STRUGGLING TO OVERTHROW THEIRRATIONAL SOCIETY OF THE PRESENT AND OUT OF THE MATERIAL TO BUILD THERATIONAL SOCIETY OF THE FUTURE  MUCH MORE HE SAID THAT WOULD TAKE TOOLONG TO WRITE  BUT I SHALL NEVER FORGET HOW HE DESCRIBED THE LIFE AMONGTHE REVOLUTIONISTS  ALL HALTING UTTERANCE VANISHED  HIS VOICE GREWSTRONG AND CONFIDENT  AND IT GLOWED AS HE GLOWED  AND AS THE THOUGHTSGLOWED THAT POURED OUT FROM HIM  HE SAID  AMONGST THE REVOLUTIONISTS I FOUND  ALSO  WARM FAITH IN THE HUMAN ARDENT IDEALISM  SWEETNESSES OF UNSELFISHNESS  RENUNCIATION  ANDMARTYRDOM  ALL THE SPLENDID  STINGING THINGS OF THE SPIRIT  HERE LIFEWAS CLEAN  NOBLE  AND ALIVE  I WAS IN TOUCH WITH GREAT SOULS WHO EXALTEDFLESH AND SPIRIT OVER DOLLARS AND CENTS  AND TO WHOM THE THIN WAIL OFTHE STARVED SLUM CHILD MEANT MORE THAN ALL THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OFCOMMERCIAL EXPANSION AND WORLD EMPIRE  ALL ABOUT ME WERE NOBLENESS OFPURPOSE AND HEROISM OF EFFORT  AND MY DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE SUNSHINEAND STARSHINE  ALL FIRE AND DEW  WITH BEFORE MY EYES  EVER BURNINGAND BLAZING  THE HOLY GRAIL  CHRIST S OWN GRAIL  THE WARM HUMAN LONG SUFFERING AND MALTREATED BUT TO BE RESCUED AND SAVED AT THE LAST  AS BEFORE I HAD SEEN HIM TRANSFIGURED  SO NOW HE STOOD TRANSFIGUREDBEFORE ME  HIS BROWS WERE BRIGHT WITH THE DIVINE THAT WAS IN HIM  ANDBRIGHTER YET SHONE HIS EYES FROM THE MIDST OF THE RADIANCE THAT SEEMEDTO ENVELOP HIM AS A MANTLE  BUT THE OTHERS DID NOT SEE THIS RADIANCE AND I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE TEARS OF JOY AND LOVE THAT DIMMEDMY VISION  AT ANY RATE  MR  WICKSON  WHO SAT BEHIND ME  WAS UNAFFECTED FOR I HEARD HIM SNEER ALOUD   UTOPIAN          THE PEOPLE OF THAT AGE WERE PHRASE SLAVES   THE ABJECTNESS     OF THEIR SERVITUDE IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US   THERE WAS A     MAGIC IN WORDS GREATER THAN THE CONJURER S ART   SO     BEFUDDLED AND CHAOTIC WERE THEIR MINDS THAT THE UTTERANCE OF     A SINGLE WORD COULD NEGATIVE THE GENERALIZATIONS OF A     LIFETIME OF SERIOUS RESEARCH AND THOUGHT  SUCH A WORD WAS     THE ADJECTIVE UTOPIAN   THE MERE UTTERANCE OF IT COULD DAMN     ANY SCHEME  NO MATTER HOW SANELY CONCEIVED  OF ECONOMIC     AMELIORATION OR REGENERATION   VAST POPULATIONS GREW     FRENZIED OVER SUCH PHRASES AS  AN HONEST DOLLAR  AND  A FULL     DINNER PAIL    THE COINAGE OF SUCH PHRASES WAS CONSIDERED     STROKES OF GENIUS ERNEST WENT ON TO HIS RISE IN SOCIETY  TILL AT LAST HE CAME IN TOUCHWITH MEMBERS OF THE UPPER CLASSES  AND RUBBED SHOULDERS WITH THE MENWHO SAT IN THE HIGH PLACES  THEN CAME HIS DISILLUSIONMENT  AND THISDISILLUSIONMENT HE DESCRIBED IN TERMS THAT DID NOT FLATTER HIS AUDIENCE HE WAS SURPRISED AT THE COMMONNESS OF THE CLAY  LIFE PROVED NOT TO BEFINE AND GRACIOUS  HE WAS APPALLED BY THE SELFISHNESS HE ENCOUNTERED AND WHAT HAD SURPRISED HIM EVEN MORE THAN THAT WAS THE ABSENCE OFINTELLECTUAL LIFE  FRESH FROM HIS REVOLUTIONISTS  HE WAS SHOCKED BY THEINTELLECTUAL STUPIDITY OF THE MASTER CLASS  AND THEN  IN SPITE OF THEIRMAGNIFICENT CHURCHES AND WELL PAID PREACHERS  HE HAD FOUND THE MASTERS MEN AND WOMEN  GROSSLY MATERIAL  IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY PRATTLED SWEETLITTLE IDEALS AND DEAR LITTLE MORALITIES  BUT IN SPITE OF THEIR PRATTLETHE DOMINANT KEY OF THE LIFE THEY LIVED WAS MATERIALISTIC  AND THEY WEREWITHOUT REAL MORALITY  FOR INSTANCE  THAT WHICH CHRIST HAD PREACHED BUTWHICH WAS NO LONGER PREACHED  I MET MEN   HE SAID   WHO INVOKED THE NAME OF THE PRINCE OF PEACEIN THEIR DIATRIBES AGAINST WAR  AND WHO PUT RIFLES IN THE HANDS OFPINKERTONS  WITH WHICH TO SHOOT DOWN STRIKERS IN THEIR OWN FACTORIES  IMET MEN INCOHERENT WITH INDIGNATION AT THE BRUTALITY OF PRIZE FIGHTING AND WHO  AT THE SAME TIME  WERE PARTIES TO THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD THATKILLED EACH YEAR MORE BABES THAN EVEN RED HANDED HEROD HAD KILLED        ORIGINALLY  THEY WERE PRIVATE DETECTIVES  BUT THEY QUICKLY     BECAME HIRED FIGHTING MEN OF THE CAPITALISTS  AND ULTIMATELY     DEVELOPED INTO THE MERCENARIES OF THE OLIGARCHY  THIS DELICATE  ARISTOCRATIC FEATURED GENTLEMAN WAS A DUMMY DIRECTORAND A TOOL OF CORPORATIONS THAT SECRETLY ROBBED WIDOWS AND ORPHANS  THISGENTLEMAN  WHO COLLECTED FINE EDITIONS AND WAS A PATRON OF LITERATURE PAID BLACKMAIL TO A HEAVY JOWLED  BLACK BROWED BOSS OF A MUNICIPALMACHINE  THIS EDITOR  WHO PUBLISHED PATENT MEDICINE ADVERTISEMENTS CALLED ME A SCOUNDRELLY DEMAGOGUE BECAUSE I DARED HIM TO PRINT IN HISPAPER THE TRUTH ABOUT PATENT MEDICINES   THIS MAN  TALKING SOBERLY ANDEARNESTLY ABOUT THE BEAUTIES OF IDEALISM AND THE GOODNESS OF GOD  HADJUST BETRAYED HIS COMRADES IN A BUSINESS DEAL  THIS MAN  A PILLAR OF THECHURCH AND HEAVY CONTRIBUTOR TO FOREIGN MISSIONS  WORKED HIS SHOP GIRLSTEN HOURS A DAY ON A STARVATION WAGE AND THEREBY DIRECTLY ENCOURAGEDPROSTITUTION  THIS MAN  WHO ENDOWED CHAIRS IN UNIVERSITIES AND ERECTEDMAGNIFICENT CHAPELS  PERJURED HIMSELF IN COURTS OF LAW OVER DOLLARSAND CENTS  THIS RAILROAD MAGNATE BROKE HIS WORD AS A CITIZEN  AS AGENTLEMAN  AND AS A CHRISTIAN  WHEN HE GRANTED A SECRET REBATE  AND HEGRANTED MANY SECRET REBATES  THIS SENATOR WAS THE TOOL AND THE SLAVE THE LITTLE PUPPET  OF A BRUTAL UNEDUCATED MACHINE BOSS    SO WAS THISGOVERNOR AND THIS SUPREME COURT JUDGE  AND ALL THREE RODE ON RAILROADPASSES  AND  ALSO  THIS SLEEK CAPITALIST OWNED THE MACHINE  THE MACHINEBOSS  AND THE RAILROADS THAT ISSUED THE PASSES        PATENT MEDICINES WERE PATENT LIES  BUT  LIKE THE CHARMS     AND INDULGENCES OF THE MIDDLE AGES  THEY DECEIVED THE     PEOPLE   THE ONLY DIFFERENCE LAY IN THAT THE PATENT     MEDICINES WERE MORE HARMFUL AND MORE COSTLY         EVEN AS LATE AS       A D   THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE     STILL PERSISTED IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY RULED THE COUNTRY BY     VIRTUE OF THEIR BALLOTS   IN REALITY  THE COUNTRY WAS RULED     BY WHAT WERE CALLED POLITICAL MACHINES   AT FIRST THE     MACHINE BOSSES CHARGED THE MASTER CAPITALISTS EXTORTIONATE     TOLLS FOR LEGISLATION  BUT IN A SHORT TIME THE MASTER     CAPITALISTS FOUND IT CHEAPER TO OWN THE POLITICAL MACHINES     THEMSELVES AND TO HIRE THE MACHINE BOSSES  AND SO IT WAS  INSTEAD OF IN PARADISE  THAT I FOUND MYSELF IN THEARID DESERT OF COMMERCIALISM  I FOUND NOTHING BUT STUPIDITY  EXCEPT FORBUSINESS  I FOUND NONE CLEAN  NOBLE  AND ALIVE  THOUGH I FOUND MANY WHOWERE ALIVE  WITH ROTTENNESS  WHAT I DID FIND WAS MONSTROUS SELFISHNESSAND HEARTLESSNESS  AND A GROSS  GLUTTONOUS  PRACTISED  AND PRACTICALMATERIALISM  MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT INTELLECTUALLY THEY HAD BORED HIM  MORALLY AND SPIRITUALLY THEY HADSICKENED HIM  SO THAT HE WAS GLAD TO GO BACK TO HIS REVOLUTIONISTS  WHOWERE CLEAN  NOBLE  AND ALIVE  AND ALL THAT THE CAPITALISTS WERE NOT  AND NOW   HE SAID   LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THAT REVOLUTION  BUT FIRST I MUST SAY THAT HIS TERRIBLE DIATRIBE HAD NOT TOUCHED THEM  ILOOKED ABOUT ME AT THEIR FACES AND SAW THAT THEY REMAINED COMPLACENTLYSUPERIOR TO WHAT HE HAD CHARGED  AND I REMEMBERED WHAT HE HAD TOLD ME THAT NO INDICTMENT OF THEIR MORALITY COULD SHAKE THEM  HOWEVER  I COULDSEE THAT THE BOLDNESS OF HIS LANGUAGE HAD AFFECTED MISS BRENTWOOD  SHEWAS LOOKING WORRIED AND APPREHENSIVE ERNEST BEGAN BY DESCRIBING THE ARMY OF REVOLUTION  AND AS HE GAVE THEFIGURES OF ITS STRENGTH  THE VOTES CAST IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES   THEASSEMBLAGE BEGAN TO GROW RESTLESS  CONCERN SHOWED IN THEIR FACES  AND INOTICED A TIGHTENING OF LIPS  AT LAST THE GAGE OF BATTLE HAD BEEN THROWNDOWN  HE DESCRIBED THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE SOCIALISTS THATUNITED THE MILLION AND A HALF IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THE TWENTY THREEMILLIONS AND A HALF IN THE REST OF THE WORLD  SUCH AN ARMY OF REVOLUTION   HE SAID   TWENTY FIVE MILLIONS STRONG  ISA THING TO MAKE RULERS AND RULING CLASSES PAUSE AND CONSIDER  THE CRYOF THIS ARMY IS   NO QUARTER  WE WANT ALL THAT YOU POSSESS  WE WILLBE CONTENT WITH NOTHING LESS THAN ALL THAT YOU POSSESS  WE WANT IN OURHANDS THE REINS OF POWER AND THE DESTINY OF MANKIND  HERE ARE OUR HANDS THEY ARE STRONG HANDS  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR GOVERNMENTS  YOURPALACES  AND ALL YOUR PURPLED EASE AWAY FROM YOU  AND IN THAT DAYYOU SHALL WORK FOR YOUR BREAD EVEN AS THE PEASANT IN THE FIELD OR THESTARVED AND RUNTY CLERK IN YOUR METROPOLISES  HERE ARE OUR HANDS  THEYARE STRONG HANDS   AND AS HE SPOKE HE EXTENDED FROM HIS SPLENDID SHOULDERS HIS TWO GREATARMS  AND THE HORSESHOER S HANDS WERE CLUTCHING THE AIR LIKE EAGLE STALONS  HE WAS THE SPIRIT OF REGNANT LABOR AS HE STOOD THERE  HIS HANDSOUTREACHING TO REND AND CRUSH HIS AUDIENCE  I WAS AWARE OF A FAINTLYPERCEPTIBLE SHRINKING ON THE PART OF THE LISTENERS BEFORE THIS FIGUREOF REVOLUTION  CONCRETE  POTENTIAL  AND MENACING  THAT IS  THE WOMENSHRANK  AND FEAR WAS IN THEIR FACES  NOT SO WITH THE MEN  THEY WEREOF THE ACTIVE RICH  AND NOT THE IDLE  AND THEY WERE FIGHTERS  A LOW THROATY RUMBLE AROSE  LINGERED ON THE AIR A MOMENT  AND CEASED  ITWAS THE FORERUNNER OF THE SNARL  AND I WAS TO HEAR IT MANY TIMES THATNIGHT  THE TOKEN OF THE BRUTE IN MAN  THE EARNEST OF HIS PRIMITIVEPASSIONS  AND THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUS THAT THEY HAD MADE THIS SOUND IT WAS THE GROWL OF THE PACK  MOUTHED BY THE PACK  AND MOUTHED IN ALLUNCONSCIOUSNESS  AND IN THAT MOMENT  AS I SAW THE HARSHNESS FORM INTHEIR FACES AND SAW THE FIGHT LIGHT FLASHING IN THEIR EYES  I REALIZEDTHAT NOT EASILY WOULD THEY LET THEIR LORDSHIP OF THE WORLD BE WRESTEDFROM THEM ERNEST PROCEEDED WITH HIS ATTACK  HE ACCOUNTED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THEMILLION AND A HALF OF REVOLUTIONISTS IN THE UNITED STATES BY CHARGINGTHE CAPITALIST CLASS WITH HAVING MISMANAGED SOCIETY  HE SKETCHED THEECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE CAVE MAN AND OF THE SAVAGE PEOPLES OF TO DAY POINTING OUT THAT THEY POSSESSED NEITHER TOOLS NOR MACHINES  ANDPOSSESSED ONLY A NATURAL EFFICIENCY OF ONE IN PRODUCING POWER  THENHE TRACED THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINERY AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION SO THATTO DAY THE PRODUCING POWER OF CIVILIZED MAN WAS A THOUSAND TIMES GREATERTHAN THAT OF THE SAVAGE  FIVE MEN   HE SAID   CAN PRODUCE BREAD FOR A THOUSAND  ONE MAN CANPRODUCE COTTON CLOTH FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE  WOOLLENS FORTHREE HUNDRED  AND BOOTS AND SHOES FOR A THOUSAND  ONE WOULD CONCLUDEFROM THIS THAT UNDER A CAPABLE MANAGEMENT OF SOCIETY MODERN CIVILIZEDMAN WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER OFF THAN THE CAVE MAN  BUT IS HE  LETUS SEE  IN THE UNITED STATES TO DAY THERE ARE FIFTEEN MILLION  PEOPLELIVING IN POVERTY  AND BY POVERTY IS MEANT THAT CONDITION IN LIFE INWHICH  THROUGH LACK OF FOOD AND ADEQUATE SHELTER  THE MERE STANDARD OFWORKING EFFICIENCY CANNOT BE MAINTAINED  IN THE UNITED STATES TO DAY  INSPITE OF ALL YOUR SO CALLED LABOR LEGISLATION  THERE ARE THREE MILLIONSOF CHILD LABORERS    IN TWELVE YEARS THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DOUBLED AND IN PASSING I WILL ASK YOU MANAGERS OF SOCIETY WHY YOU DID NOT MAKEPUBLIC THE CENSUS FIGURES OF       AND I WILL ANSWER FOR YOU  THATYOU WERE AFRAID  THE FIGURES OF MISERY WOULD HAVE PRECIPITATED THEREVOLUTION THAT EVEN NOW IS GATHERING        ROBERT HUNTER  IN       IN A BOOK

WHICH WERE MADE PUBLIC   THE NUMBER OF CHILD     LABORERS WAS PLACED AT            BUT TO RETURN TO MY INDICTMENT  IF MODERN MAN S PRODUCING POWER ISA THOUSAND TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF THE CAVE MAN  WHY THEN  IN THEUNITED STATES TO DAY  ARE THERE FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE NOTPROPERLY SHELTERED AND PROPERLY FED  WHY THEN  IN THE UNITED STATESTO DAY  ARE THERE THREE MILLION CHILD LABORERS  IT IS A TRUE INDICTMENT THE CAPITALIST CLASS HAS MISMANAGED  IN FACE OF THE FACTS THAT MODERNMAN LIVES MORE WRETCHEDLY THAN THE CAVE MAN  AND THAT HIS PRODUCINGPOWER IS A THOUSAND TIMES GREATER THAN THAT

VIADUMBRATIONSIT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT THE WARNINGS OF COMING EVENTS BEGAN TO FALLABOUT US THICK AND FAST  ERNEST HAD ALREADY QUESTIONED FATHER S POLICYOF HAVING SOCIALISTS AND LABOR LEADERS AT HIS HOUSE  AND OF OPENLYATTENDING SOCIALIST MEETINGS  AND FATHER HAD ONLY LAUGHED AT HIM FORHIS PAINS  AS FOR MYSELF  I WAS LEARNING MUCH FROM THIS CONTACT WITH THEWORKING CLASS LEADERS AND THINKERS  I WAS SEEING THE OTHER SIDE OFTHE SHIELD  I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE UNSELFISHNESS AND HIGH IDEALISMI ENCOUNTERED  THOUGH I WAS APPALLED BY THE VAST PHILOSOPHIC ANDSCIENTIFIC LITERATURE OF SOCIALISM THAT WAS OPENED UP TO ME  I WASLEARNING FAST  BUT I LEARNED NOT FAST ENOUGH TO REALIZE THEN THE PERILOF OUR POSITION THERE WERE WARNINGS  BUT I DID NOT HEED THEM  FOR INSTANCE  MRS PERTONWAITHE AND MRS  WICKSON EXERCISED TREMENDOUS SOCIAL POWER INTHE UNIVERSITY TOWN  AND FROM THEM EMANATED THE SENTIMENT THAT I WAS ATOO FORWARD AND SELF ASSERTIVE YOUNG WOMAN WITH A MISCHIEVOUS PENCHANTFOR OFFICIOUSNESS AND INTERFERENCE IN OTHER PERSONS  AFFAIRS  THISI THOUGHT NO MORE THAN NATURAL  CONSIDERING THE PART I HAD PLAYEDIN INVESTIGATING THE CASE OF JACKSON S ARM  BUT THE EFFECT OF SUCHA SENTIMENT  ENUNCIATED BY TWO SUCH POWERFUL SOCIAL ARBITERS  IUNDERESTIMATED TRUE  I NOTICED A CERTAIN ALOOFNESS ON THE PART OF MY GENERAL FRIENDS BUT THIS I ASCRIBED TO THE DISAPPROVAL THAT WAS PREVALENT IN MY CIRCLESOF MY INTENDED MARRIAGE WITH ERNEST  IT WAS NOT TILL SOME TIME AFTERWARDTHAT ERNEST POINTED OUT TO ME CLEARLY THAT THIS GENERAL ATTITUDE OFMY CLASS WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN SPONTANEOUS  THAT BEHIND IT WERE THEHIDDEN SPRINGS OF AN ORGANIZED CONDUCT   YOU HAVE GIVEN SHELTER TO ANENEMY OF YOUR CLASS   HE SAID   AND NOT ALONE SHELTER  FOR YOU HAVEGIVEN YOUR LOVE  YOURSELF  THIS IS TREASON TO YOUR CLASS  THINK NOT THATYOU WILL ESCAPE BEING PENALIZED  BUT IT WAS BEFORE THIS THAT FATHER RETURNED ONE AFTERNOON  ERNEST WASWITH ME  AND WE COULD SEE THAT FATHER WAS ANGRY  PHILOSOPHICALLY ANGRY HE WAS RARELY REALLY ANGRY  BUT A CERTAIN MEASURE OF CONTROLLED ANGERHE ALLOWED HIMSELF  HE CALLED IT A TONIC  AND WE COULD SEE THAT HE WASTONIC ANGRY WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM  WHAT DO YOU THINK   HE DEMANDED   I HAD LUNCHEON WITH WILCOX  WILCOX WAS THE SUPERANNUATED PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY  WHOSE WITHEREDMIND WAS STORED WITH GENERALIZATIONS THAT WERE YOUNG IN       AND WHICHHE HAD SINCE FAILED TO REVISE  I WAS INVITED   FATHER ANNOUNCED   I WAS SENT FOR  HE PAUSED  AND WE WAITED  OH  IT WAS DONE VERY NICELY  I LL ALLOW  BUT I WAS REPRIMANDED  I  ANDBY THAT OLD FOSSIL   I LL WAGER I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE REPRIMANDED FOR   ERNEST SAID  NOT IN THREE GUESSES   FATHER LAUGHED  ONE GUESS WILL DO   ERNEST RETORTED   AND IT WON T BE A GUESS  IT WILLBE A DEDUCTION  YOU WERE REPRIMANDED FOR YOUR PRIVATE LIFE   THE VERY THING   FATHER CRIED   HOW DID YOU GUESS   I KNEW IT WAS COMING  I WARNED YOU BEFORE ABOUT IT   YES  YOU DID   FATHER MEDITATED   BUT I COULDN T BELIEVE IT  AT ANYRATE  IT IS ONLY SO MUCH MORE CLINCHING EVIDENCE FOR MY BOOK   IT IS NOTHING TO WHAT WILL COME   ERNEST WENT ON   IF YOU PERSIST INYOUR POLICY OF HAVING THESE SOCIALISTS AND RADICALS OF ALL SORTS AT YOURHOUSE  MYSELF INCLUDED   JUST WHAT OLD WILCOX SAID  AND OF ALL UNWARRANTED THINGS  HE SAID ITWAS IN POOR TASTE  UTTERLY PROFITLESS  ANYWAY  AND NOT IN HARMONY WITHUNIVERSITY TRADITIONS AND POLICY  HE SAID MUCH MORE OF THE SAME VAGUESORT  AND I COULDN T PIN HIM DOWN TO ANYTHING SPECIFIC  I MADE IT PRETTYAWKWARD FOR HIM  AND HE COULD ONLY GO ON REPEATING HIMSELF AND TELLINGME HOW MUCH HE HONORED ME  AND ALL THE WORLD HONORED ME  AS A SCIENTIST IT WASN T AN AGREEABLE TASK FOR HIM  I COULD SEE HE DIDN T LIKE IT   HE WAS NOT A FREE AGENT   ERNEST SAID   THE LEG BAR  IS NOT ALWAYS WORNGRACIOUSLY         LEG BAR  THE AFRICAN SLAVES WERE SO MANACLED  ALSO     CRIMINALS   IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE COMING OF THE BROTHERHOOD     OF MAN THAT THE LEG BAR PASSED OUT OF USE  YES  I GOT THAT MUCH OUT OF HIM  HE SAID THE UNIVERSITY NEEDED EVERSO MUCH MORE MONEY THIS YEAR THAN THE STATE WAS WILLING TO FURNISH  ANDTHAT IT MUST COME FROM WEALTHY PERSONAGES WHO COULD NOT BUT BE OFFENDEDBY THE SWERVING OF THE UNIVERSITY FROM ITS HIGH IDEAL OF THE PASSIONLESSPURSUIT OF PASSIONLESS INTELLIGENCE  WHEN I TRIED TO PIN HIM DOWN TOWHAT MY HOME LIFE HAD TO DO WITH SWERVING THE UNIVERSITY FROM ITS HIGHIDEAL  HE OFFERED ME A TWO YEARS  VACATION  ON FULL PAY  IN EUROPE FOR RECREATION AND RESEARCH  OF COURSE I COULDN T ACCEPT IT UNDER THECIRCUMSTANCES   IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER IF YOU HAD   ERNEST SAID GRAVELY  IT WAS A BRIBE   FATHER PROTESTED  AND ERNEST NODDED  ALSO  THE BEGGAR SAID THAT THERE WAS TALK  TEA TABLE GOSSIP AND SOFORTH  ABOUT MY DAUGHTER BEING SEEN IN PUBLIC WITH SO NOTORIOUS ACHARACTER AS YOU  AND THAT IT WAS NOT IN KEEPING WITH UNIVERSITY TONEAND DIGNITY  NOT THAT HE PERSONALLY OBJECTED  OH  NO  BUT THAT THERE WASTALK AND THAT I WOULD UNDERSTAND  ERNEST CONSIDERED THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR A MOMENT  AND THEN SAID  AND HISFACE WAS VERY GRAVE  WITHAL THERE WAS A SOMBRE WRATH IN IT  THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL  SOMEBODY HASPUT PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT WILCOX   DO YOU THINK SO   FATHER ASKED  AND HIS FACE SHOWED THAT HE WASINTERESTED RATHER THAN FRIGHTENED  I WISH I COULD CONVEY TO YOU THE CONCEPTION THAT IS DIMLY FORMING IN MYOWN MIND   ERNEST SAID   NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAS SOCIETYIN SO TERRIFIC FLUX AS IT IS RIGHT NOW  THE SWIFT CHANGES IN OURINDUSTRIAL SYSTEM ARE CAUSING EQUALLY SWIFT CHANGES IN OUR RELIGIOUS POLITICAL  AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES  AN UNSEEN AND FEARFUL REVOLUTION ISTAKING PLACE IN THE FIBRE AND STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY  ONE CAN ONLY DIMLYFEEL THESE THINGS  BUT THEY ARE IN THE AIR  NOW  TO DAY  ONE CAN FEELTHE LOOM OF THEM  THINGS VAST  VAGUE  AND TERRIBLE  MY MIND RECOILS FROMCONTEMPLATION OF WHAT THEY MAY CRYSTALLIZE INTO  YOU HEARD WICKSON TALKTHE OTHER NIGHT  BEHIND WHAT HE SAID WERE THE SAME NAMELESS  FORMLESSTHINGS THAT I FEEL  HE SPOKE OUT OF A SUPERCONSCIOUS APPREHENSION OFTHEM   YOU MEAN          FATHER BEGAN  THEN PAUSED  I MEAN THAT THERE IS A SHADOW OF SOMETHING COLOSSAL AND MENACING THATEVEN NOW IS BEGINNING TO FALL ACROSS THE LAND  CALL IT THE SHADOW OF ANOLIGARCHY  IF YOU WILL  IT IS THE NEAREST I DARE APPROXIMATE IT  WHATITS NATURE MAY BE I REFUSE TO IMAGINE   BUT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WASTHIS  YOU ARE IN A PERILOUS POSITION  A PERIL THAT MY OWN FEAR ENHANCESBECAUSE I AM NOT ABLE EVEN TO MEASURE IT  TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THEVACATION         THOUGH  LIKE EVERHARD  THEY DID NOT DREAM OF THE NATURE OF     IT  THERE WERE MEN  EVEN BEFORE HIS TIME  WHO CAUGHT     GLIMPSES OF THE SHADOW   JOHN C  CALHOUN SAID   A POWER HAS     RISEN UP IN THE GOVERNMENT GREATER THAN THE PEOPLE     THEMSELVES  CONSISTING OF MANY AND VARIOUS AND POWERFUL     INTERESTS  COMBINED INTO ONE MASS  AND HELD TOGETHER BY THE     COHESIVE POWER OF THE VAST SURPLUS IN THE BANKS    AND THAT     GREAT HUMANIST  ABRAHAM LINCOLN  SAID  JUST BEFORE HIS     ASSASSINATION   I SEE IN THE NEAR FUTURE A CRISIS     APPROACHING THAT UNNERVES ME AND CAUSES ME TO TREMBLE FOR     THE SAFETY OF MY COUNTRY         CORPORATIONS HAVE BEEN     ENTHRONED  AN ERA OF CORRUPTION IN HIGH PLACES WILL FOLLOW      AND THE MONEY POWER OF THE COUNTRY WILL ENDEAVOR TO PROLONG     ITS REIGN BY WORKING UPON THE PREJUDICES OF THE PEOPLE UNTIL     THE WEALTH IS AGGREGATED IN A FEW HANDS AND THE REPUBLIC IS     DESTROYED   BUT IT WOULD BE COWARDLY   WAS THE PROTEST  NOT AT ALL  YOU ARE AN OLD MAN  YOU HAVE DONE YOUR WORK IN THE WORLD AND A GREAT WORK  LEAVE THE PRESENT BATTLE TO YOUTH AND STRENGTH  WEYOUNG FELLOWS HAVE OUR WORK YET TO DO  AVIS WILL STAND BY MY SIDE INWHAT IS TO COME  SHE WILL BE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE BATTLE FRONT   BUT THEY CAN T HURT ME   FATHER OBJECTED   THANK GOD I AM INDEPENDENT OH  I ASSURE YOU  I KNOW THE FRIGHTFUL PERSECUTION THEY CAN WAGE ONA PROFESSOR WHO IS ECONOMICALLY DEPENDENT ON HIS UNIVERSITY  BUT I AMINDEPENDENT  I HAVE NOT BEEN A PROFESSOR FOR THE SAKE OF MY SALARY  ICAN GET ALONG VERY COMFORTABLY ON MY OWN INCOME  AND THE SALARY IS ALLTHEY CAN TAKE AWAY FROM ME   BUT YOU DO NOT REALIZE   ERNEST ANSWERED   IF ALL THAT I FEAR BE SO YOUR PRIVATE INCOME  YOUR PRINCIPAL ITSELF  CAN BE TAKEN FROM YOU JUSTAS EASILY AS YOUR SALARY  FATHER WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MINUTES  HE WAS THINKING DEEPLY  AND I COULDSEE THE LINES OF DECISION FORMING IN HIS FACE  AT LAST HE SPOKE  I SHALL NOT TAKE THE VACATION   HE PAUSED AGAIN   I SHALL GO ON WITHMY BOOK   YOU MAY BE WRONG  BUT WHETHER YOU ARE WRONG OR RIGHT  I SHALLSTAND BY MY GUNS         THIS BOOK   ECONOMICS AND EDUCATION   WAS PUBLISHED IN     THAT YEAR  THREE COPIES OF IT ARE EXTANT  TWO AT ARDIS  AND     ONE AT ASGARD   IT DEALT  IN ELABORATE DETAIL  WITH ONE     FACTOR IN THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ESTABLISHED  NAMELY  THE     CAPITALISTIC BIAS OF THE UNIVERSITIES AND COMMON SCHOOLS      IT WAS A LOGICAL AND CRUSHING INDICTMENT OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM     OF EDUCATION THAT DEVELOPED IN THE MINDS OF THE STUDENTS     ONLY SUCH IDEAS AS WERE FAVORABLE TO THE CAPITALISTIC     REGIME  TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL IDEAS THAT WERE INIMICAL AND     SUBVERSIVE   THE BOOK CREATED A FUROR  AND WAS PROMPTLY     SUPPRESSED BY THE OLIGARCHY  ALL RIGHT   ERNEST SAID   YOU ARE TRAVELLING THE SAME PATH THAT BISHOPMOREHOUSE IS  AND TOWARD A SIMILAR SMASH UP  YOU LL BOTH BE PROLETARIANSBEFORE YOU RE DONE WITH IT  THE CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THE BISHOP  AND WE GOT ERNEST TO EXPLAINWHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING WITH HIM  HE IS SOUL SICK FROM THE JOURNEY THROUGH HELL I HAVE GIVEN HIM  I TOOKHIM THROUGH THE HOMES OF A FEW OF OUR FACTORY WORKERS  I SHOWED HIM THEHUMAN WRECKS CAST ASIDE BY THE INDUSTRIAL MACHINE  AND HE LISTENED TOTHEIR LIFE STORIES  I TOOK HIM THROUGH THE SLUMS OF SAN FRANCISCO  ANDIN DRUNKENNESS  PROSTITUTION  AND CRIMINALITY HE LEARNED A DEEPER CAUSETHAN INNATE DEPRAVITY  HE IS VERY SICK  AND  WORSE THAN THAT  HE HAS GOTOUT OF HAND  HE IS TOO ETHICAL  HE HAS BEEN TOO SEVERELY TOUCHED  AND AS USUAL  HE IS UNPRACTICAL  HE IS UP IN THE AIR WITH ALL KINDS OFETHICAL DELUSIONS AND PLANS FOR MISSION WORK AMONG THE CULTURED  HEFEELS IT IS HIS BOUNDEN DUTY TO RESURRECT THE ANCIENT SPIRIT OF THECHURCH AND TO DELIVER ITS MESSAGE TO THE MASTERS  HE IS OVERWROUGHT SOONER OR LATER HE IS GOING TO BREAK OUT  AND THEN THERE S GOING TO BEA SMASH UP  WHAT FORM IT WILL TAKE I CAN T EVEN GUESS  HE IS A PURE EXALTED SOUL  BUT HE IS SO UNPRACTICAL  HE S BEYOND ME  I CAN T KEEPHIS FEET ON THE EARTH  AND THROUGH THE AIR HE IS RUSHING ON TO HISGETHSEMANE  AND AFTER THIS HIS CRUCIFIXION  SUCH HIGH SOULS ARE MADE FORCRUCIFIXION   AND YOU   I ASKED  AND BENEATH MY SMILE WAS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEANXIETY OF LOVE  NOT I   HE LAUGHED BACK   I MAY BE EXECUTED  OR ASSASSINATED  BUT ISHALL NEVER BE CRUCIFIED  I AM PLANTED TOO SOLIDLY AND STOLIDLY UPON THEEARTH   BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BRING ABOUT THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE BISHOP   I ASKED  YOU WILL NOT DENY THAT YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF IT   WHY SHOULD I LEAVE ONE COMFORTABLE SOUL IN COMFORT WHEN THERE AREMILLIONS IN TRAVAIL AND MISERY   HE DEMANDED BACK  THEN WHY DID YOU ADVISE FATHER TO ACCEPT THE VACATION   BECAUSE I AM NOT A PURE  EXALTED SOUL   WAS THE ANSWER   BECAUSE I AMSOLID AND STOLID AND SELFISH  BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AND  LIKE RUTH OFOLD  THY PEOPLE ARE MY PEOPLE  AS FOR THE BISHOP  HE HAS NO DAUGHTER BESIDES  NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE GOOD  NEVERTHELESS HIS LITTLEINADEQUATE WAIL WILL BE PRODUCTIVE OF SOME GOOD IN THE REVOLUTION  ANDEVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS  I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST  I KNEW WELL THE NOBLE NATURE OFBISHOP MOREHOUSE  AND I COULD NOT CONCEIVE THAT HIS VOICE RAISED FORRIGHTEOUSNESS WOULD BE NO MORE THAN A LITTLE INADEQUATE WAIL  BUT I DIDNOT YET HAVE THE HARSH FACTS OF LIFE AT MY FINGERS  ENDS AS ERNEST HAD HE SAW CLEARLY THE FUTILITY OF THE BISHOP S GREAT SOUL  AS COMING EVENTSWERE SOON TO SHOW AS CLEARLY TO ME IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER THIS DAY THAT ERNEST TOLD ME  AS A GOOD STORY  THEOFFER HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT  NAMELY  AN APPOINTMENT ASUNITED STATES COMMISSIONER OF LABOR  I WAS OVERJOYED  THE SALARY WASCOMPARATIVELY LARGE  AND WOULD MAKE SAFE OUR MARRIAGE  AND THEN ITSURELY WAS CONGENIAL WORK FOR ERNEST  AND  FURTHERMORE  MY JEALOUS PRIDEIN HIM MADE ME HAIL THE PROFFERED APPOINTMENT AS A RECOGNITION OF HISABILITIES THEN I NOTICED THE TWINKLE IN HIS EYES  HE WAS LAUGHING AT ME  YOU ARE NOT GOING TO       TO DECLINE   I QUAVERED  IT IS A BRIBE   HE SAID   BEHIND IT IS THE FINE HAND OF WICKSON  ANDBEHIND HIM THE HANDS OF GREATER MEN THAN HE  IT IS AN OLD TRICK  OLD ASTHE CLASS STRUGGLE IS OLD  STEALING THE CAPTAINS FROM THE ARMY OF LABOR POOR BETRAYED LABOR  IF YOU BUT KNEW HOW MANY OF ITS LEADERS HAVE BEENBOUGHT OUT IN SIMILAR WAYS IN THE PAST  IT IS CHEAPER  SO MUCH CHEAPER TO BUY A GENERAL THAN TO FIGHT HIM AND HIS WHOLE ARMY  THERE WAS  BUTI LL NOT CALL ANY NAMES  I M BITTER ENOUGH OVER IT AS IT IS  DEAR HEART I AM A CAPTAIN OF LABOR  I COULD NOT SELL OUT  IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THE MEMORY OF MY POOR OLD FATHER AND THE WAY HE WAS WORKED TO DEATHWOULD PREVENT  THE TEARS WERE IN HIS EYES  THIS GREAT  STRONG HERO OF MINE  HE NEVERCOULD FORGIVE THE WAY HIS FATHER HAD BEEN MALFORMED  THE SORDID LIES ANDTHE PETTY THEFTS HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO  IN ORDER TO PUT FOOD IN HISCHILDREN S MOUTHS  MY FATHER WAS A GOOD MAN   ERNEST ONCE SAID TO ME   THE SOUL OF HIM WASGOOD  AND YET IT WAS TWISTED  AND MAIMED  AND BLUNTED BY THE SAVAGERYOF HIS LIFE  HE WAS MADE INTO A BROKEN DOWN BEAST BY HIS MASTERS  THEARCH BEASTS  HE SHOULD BE ALIVE TO DAY  LIKE YOUR FATHER  HE HAD ASTRONG CONSTITUTION  BUT HE WAS CAUGHT IN THE MACHINE AND WORKED TODEATH  FOR PROFIT  THINK OF IT  FOR PROFIT  HIS LIFE BLOOD TRANSMUTEDINTO A WINE SUPPER  OR A JEWELLED GEWGAW  OR SOME SIMILAR SENSE ORGY OFTHE PARASITIC AND IDLE RICH  HIS MASTERS  THE ARCH BEASTS  CHAPTER VIITHE BISHOP S VISION THE BISHOP IS OUT OF HAND   ERNEST WROTE ME   HE IS CLEAR UP IN THEAIR  TONIGHT HE IS GOING TO BEGIN PUTTING TO RIGHTS THIS VERY MISERABLEWORLD OF OURS  HE IS GOING TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE  HE HAS TOLD ME SO AND I CANNOT DISSUADE HIM  TO NIGHT HE IS CHAIRMAN OF THE I P H    ANDHE WILL EMBODY HIS MESSAGE IN HIS INTRODUCTORY REMARKS        THERE IS NO CLEW TO THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR WHICH     THESE INITIALS STAND  MAY I BRING YOU TO HEAR HIM  OF COURSE  HE IS FOREDOOMED TO FUTILITY IT WILL BREAK YOUR HEART  IT WILL BREAK HIS  BUT FOR YOU IT WILL BE ANEXCELLENT OBJECT LESSON  YOU KNOW  DEAR HEART  HOW PROUD I AM BECAUSEYOU LOVE ME  AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY FULLEST VALUE  IWANT TO REDEEM  IN YOUR EYES  SOME SMALL MEASURE OF MY UNWORTHINESS AND SO IT IS THAT MY PRIDE DESIRES THAT YOU SHALL KNOW MY THINKING ISCORRECT AND RIGHT  MY VIEWS ARE HARSH  THE FUTILITY OF SO NOBLE A SOULAS THE BISHOP WILL SHOW YOU THE COMPULSION FOR SUCH HARSHNESS  SO COMETO NIGHT  SAD THOUGH THIS NIGHT S HAPPENING WILL BE  I FEEL THAT IT WILLBUT DRAW YOU MORE CLOSELY TO ME  THE I P H  HELD ITS CONVENTION THAT NIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO   THISCONVENTION HAD BEEN CALLED TO CONSIDER PUBLIC IMMORALITY AND THE REMEDYFOR IT  BISHOP MOREHOUSE PRESIDED  HE WAS VERY NERVOUS AS HE SAT ON THEPLATFORM  AND I COULD SEE THE HIGH TENSION HE WAS UNDER  BY HIS SIDEWERE BISHOP DICKINSON  H  H  JONES  THE HEAD OF THE ETHICAL DEPARTMENTIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  MRS  W  W  HURD  THE GREAT CHARITYORGANIZER  PHILIP WARD  THE EQUALLY GREAT PHILANTHROPIST  AND SEVERALLESSER LUMINARIES IN THE FIELD OF MORALITY AND CHARITY  BISHOP MOREHOUSEAROSE AND ABRUPTLY BEGAN        IT TOOK BUT A FEW MINUTES TO CROSS BY FERRY FROM BERKELEY     TO SAN FRANCISCO   THESE  AND THE OTHER BAY CITIES      PRACTICALLY COMPOSED ONE COMMUNITY  I WAS IN MY BROUGHAM  DRIVING THROUGH THE STREETS  IT WAS NIGHT TIME NOW AND THEN I LOOKED THROUGH THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS  AND SUDDENLY MY EYESSEEMED TO BE OPENED  AND I SAW THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE  AT FIRST ICOVERED MY EYES WITH MY HANDS TO SHUT OUT THE AWFUL SIGHT  AND THEN  INTHE DARKNESS  THE QUESTION CAME TO ME  WHAT IS TO BE DONE  WHAT IS TO BEDONE  A LITTLE LATER THE QUESTION CAME TO ME IN ANOTHER WAY  WHAT WOULDTHE MASTER DO  AND WITH THE QUESTION A GREAT LIGHT SEEMED TO FILLTHE PLACE  AND I SAW MY DUTY SUN CLEAR  AS SAUL SAW HIS ON THE WAY TODAMASCUS  I STOPPED THE CARRIAGE  GOT OUT  AND  AFTER A FEW MINUTES CONVERSATION  PERSUADED TWO OF THE PUBLIC WOMEN TO GET INTO THE BROUGHAMWITH ME  IF JESUS WAS RIGHT  THEN THESE TWO UNFORTUNATES WERE MYSISTERS  AND THE ONLY HOPE OF THEIR PURIFICATION WAS IN MY AFFECTION ANDTENDERNESS  I LIVE IN ONE OF THE LOVELIEST LOCALITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO  THE HOUSEIN WHICH I LIVE COST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS  AND ITS FURNISHINGS BOOKS  AND WORKS OF ART COST AS MUCH MORE  THE HOUSE IS A MANSION NO  IT IS A PALACE  WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS  I NEVER KNEW WHATPALACES WERE GOOD FOR  I HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE TO LIVE IN  BUT NOW IKNOW  I TOOK THE TWO WOMEN OF THE STREET TO MY PALACE  AND THEY AREGOING TO STAY WITH ME  I HOPE TO FILL EVERY ROOM IN MY PALACE WITH SUCHSISTERS AS THEY  THE AUDIENCE HAD BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE RESTLESS AND UNSETTLED  ANDTHE FACES OF THOSE THAT SAT ON THE PLATFORM HAD BEEN BETRAYING GREATERAND GREATER DISMAY AND CONSTERNATION  AND AT THIS POINT BISHOP DICKINSONAROSE  AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DISGUST ON HIS FACE  FLED FROM THEPLATFORM AND THE HALL  BUT BISHOP MOREHOUSE  OBLIVIOUS TO ALL  HIS EYESFILLED WITH HIS VISION  CONTINUED  OH  SISTERS AND BROTHERS  IN THIS ACT OF MINE I FIND THE SOLUTION OFALL MY DIFFICULTIES  I DIDN T KNOW WHAT BROUGHAMS WERE MADE FOR  BUT NOWI KNOW  THEY ARE MADE TO CARRY THE WEAK  THE SICK  AND THE AGED  THEYARE MADE TO SHOW HONOR TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THE SENSE EVEN OF SHAME  I DID NOT KNOW WHAT PALACES WERE MADE FOR  BUT NOW I HAVE FOUND A USEFOR THEM  THE PALACES OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE HOSPITALS AND NURSERIESFOR THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE AND ARE PERISHING  HE MADE A LONG PAUSE  PLAINLY OVERCOME BY THE THOUGHT THAT WAS IN HIM AND NERVOUS HOW BEST TO EXPRESS IT  I AM NOT FIT  DEAR BRETHREN  TO TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT MORALITY  IHAVE LIVED IN SHAME AND HYPOCRISIES TOO LONG TO BE ABLE TO HELP OTHERS BUT MY ACTION WITH THOSE WOMEN  SISTERS OF MINE  SHOWS ME THAT THEBETTER WAY IS EASY TO FIND  TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN JESUS AND HIS GOSPELTHERE CAN BE NO OTHER RELATION BETWEEN MAN AND MAN THAN THE RELATIONOF AFFECTION  LOVE ALONE IS STRONGER THAN SIN  STRONGER THAN DEATH  ITHEREFORE SAY TO THE RICH AMONG YOU THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY TO DO WHAT IHAVE DONE AND AM DOING  LET EACH ONE OF YOU WHO IS PROSPEROUS TAKE INTOHIS HOUSE SOME THIEF AND TREAT HIM AS HIS BROTHER  SOME UNFORTUNATE ANDTREAT HER AS HIS SISTER  AND SAN FRANCISCO WILL NEED NO POLICE FORCEAND NO MAGISTRATES  THE PRISONS WILL BE TURNED INTO HOSPITALS  AND THECRIMINAL WILL DISAPPEAR WITH HIS CRIME  WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE  WE MUST DO AS CHRISTDID  THAT IS THE MESSAGE OF THE CHURCH TODAY  WE HAVE WANDERED FAR FROMTHE MASTER S TEACHING  WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS  WE HAVEPUT MAMMON IN THE PLACE OF CHRIST  I HAVE HERE A POEM THAT TELLS THEWHOLE STORY  I SHOULD LIKE TO READ IT TO YOU  IT WAS WRITTEN BY ANERRING SOUL WHO YET SAW CLEARLY   IT MUST NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR AN ATTACKUPON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  IT IS AN ATTACK UPON ALL CHURCHES  UPON THEPOMP AND SPLENDOR OF ALL CHURCHES THAT HAVE WANDERED FROM THE MASTER SPATH AND HEDGED THEMSELVES IN FROM HIS LAMBS  HERE IT IS       THE SILVER TRUMPETS RANG ACROSS THE DOME              THE PEOPLE KNELT UPON THE GROUND WITH AWE              AND BORNE UPON THE NECKS OF MEN I SAW      LIKE SOME GREAT GOD  THE HOLY LORD OF ROME       PRIEST LIKE  HE WORE A ROBE MORE WHITE THAN FOAM              AND  KING LIKE  SWATHED HIMSELF IN ROYAL RED              THREE CROWNS OF GOLD ROSE HIGH UPON HIS HEAD      IN SPLENDOR AND IN LIGHT THE POPE PASSED HOME       MY HEART STOLE BACK ACROSS WIDE WASTES OF YEARS             TO ONE WHO WANDERED BY A LONELY SEA      AND SOUGHT IN VAIN FOR ANY PLACE OF REST       FOXES HAVE HOLES  AND EVERY BIRD ITS NEST              I  ONLY I  MUST WANDER WEARILY      AND BRUISE MY FEET  AND DRINK WINE SALT WITH TEARS          OSCAR WILDE  ONE OF THE LORDS OF LANGUAGE OF THE     NINETEENTH CENTURY OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA THE AUDIENCE WAS AGITATED  BUT UNRESPONSIVE  YET BISHOP MOREHOUSE WASNOT AWARE OF IT  HE HELD STEADILY ON HIS WAY  AND SO I SAY TO THE RICH AMONG YOU  AND TO ALL THE RICH  THAT BITTERLYYOU OPPRESS THE MASTER S LAMBS  YOU HAVE HARDENED YOUR HEARTS  YOU HAVECLOSED YOUR EARS TO THE VOICES THAT ARE CRYING IN THE LAND  THE VOICESOF PAIN AND SORROW THAT YOU WILL NOT HEAR BUT THAT SOME DAY WILL BEHEARD  AND SO I SAY   BUT AT THIS POINT H  H  JONES AND PHILIP WARD  WHO HAD ALREADY RISENFROM THEIR CHAIRS  LED THE BISHOP OFF THE PLATFORM  WHILE THE AUDIENCESAT BREATHLESS AND SHOCKED ERNEST LAUGHED HARSHLY AND SAVAGELY WHEN HE HAD GAINED THE STREET  HISLAUGHTER JARRED UPON ME  MY HEART SEEMED READY TO BURST WITH SUPPRESSEDTEARS  HE HAS DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE   ERNEST CRIED   THE MANHOOD AND THEDEEP HIDDEN  TENDER NATURE OF THEIR BISHOP BURST OUT  AND HIS CHRISTIANAUDIENCE  THAT LOVED HIM  CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS CRAZY  DID YOU SEE THEMLEADING HIM SO SOLICITOUSLY FROM THE PLATFORM  THERE MUST HAVE BEENLAUGHTER IN HELL AT THE SPECTACLE   NEVERTHELESS  IT WILL MAKE A GREAT IMPRESSION  WHAT THE BISHOP DID ANDSAID TO NIGHT   I SAID  THINK SO   ERNEST QUERIED MOCKINGLY  IT WILL MAKE A SENSATION   I ASSERTED   DIDN T YOU SEE THE REPORTERSSCRIBBLING LIKE MAD WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING   NOT A LINE OF WHICH WILL APPEAR IN TO MORROW S PAPERS   I CAN T BELIEVE IT   I CRIED  JUST WAIT AND SEE   WAS THE ANSWER   NOT A LINE  NOT A THOUGHT THAT HEUTTERED  THE DAILY PRESS  THE DAILY SUPPRESSAGE   BUT THE REPORTERS   I OBJECTED   I SAW THEM   NOT A WORD THAT HE UTTERED WILL SEE PRINT  YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THEEDITORS  THEY DRAW THEIR SALARIES FOR THE POLICY THEY MAINTAIN  THEIRPOLICY IS TO PRINT NOTHING THAT IS A VITAL MENACE TO THE ESTABLISHED THE BISHOP S UTTERANCE WAS A VIOLENT ASSAULT UPON THE ESTABLISHEDMORALITY  IT WAS HERESY  THEY LED HIM FROM THE PLATFORM TO PREVENT HIMFROM UTTERING MORE HERESY  THE NEWSPAPERS WILL PURGE HIS HERESY IN THEOBLIVION OF SILENCE  THE PRESS OF THE UNITED STATES  IT IS A PARASITICGROWTH THAT BATTENS ON THE CAPITALIST CLASS  ITS FUNCTION IS TO SERVETHE ESTABLISHED BY MOULDING PUBLIC OPINION  AND RIGHT WELL IT SERVES IT  LET ME PROPHESY  TO MORROW S PAPERS WILL MERELY MENTION THAT THE BISHOPIS IN POOR HEALTH  THAT HE HAS BEEN WORKING TOO HARD  AND THAT HE BROKEDOWN LAST NIGHT  THE NEXT MENTION  SOME DAYS HENCE  WILL BE TO THEEFFECT THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM NERVOUS PROSTRATION AND HAS BEEN GIVENA VACATION BY HIS GRATEFUL FLOCK  AFTER THAT  ONE OF TWO THINGS WILLHAPPEN  EITHER THE BISHOP WILL SEE THE ERROR OF HIS WAY AND RETURN FROMHIS VACATION A WELL MAN IN WHOSE EYES THERE ARE NO MORE VISIONS  OR ELSEHE WILL PERSIST IN HIS MADNESS  AND THEN YOU MAY EXPECT TO SEE IN THEPAPERS  COUCHED PATHETICALLY AND TENDERLY  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HISINSANITY  AFTER THAT HE WILL BE LEFT TO GIBBER HIS VISIONS TO PADDEDWALLS   NOW THERE YOU GO TOO FAR   I CRIED OUT  IN THE EYES OF SOCIETY IT WILL TRULY BE INSANITY   HE REPLIED   WHATHONEST MAN  WHO IS NOT INSANE  WOULD TAKE LOST WOMEN AND THIEVES INTOHIS HOUSE TO DWELL WITH HIM SISTERLY AND BROTHERLY  TRUE  CHRIST DIEDBETWEEN TWO THIEVES  BUT THAT IS ANOTHER STORY  INSANITY  THE MENTALPROCESSES OF THE MAN WITH WHOM ONE DISAGREES  ARE ALWAYS WRONG THEREFORE THE MIND OF THE MAN IS WRONG  WHERE IS THE LINE BETWEENWRONG MIND AND INSANE MIND  IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY SANE MAN CANRADICALLY DISAGREE WITH ONE S MOST SANE CONCLUSIONS  THERE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT IN THIS EVENING S PAPER  MARY MCKENNALIVES SOUTH OF MARKET STREET  SHE IS A POOR BUT HONEST WOMAN  SHE ISALSO PATRIOTIC  BUT SHE HAS ERRONEOUS IDEAS CONCERNING THE AMERICAN FLAGAND THE PROTECTION IT IS SUPPOSED TO SYMBOLIZE  AND HERE S WHAT HAPPENEDTO HER  HER HUSBAND HAD AN ACCIDENT AND WAS LAID UP IN HOSPITAL THREEMONTHS  IN SPITE OF TAKING IN WASHING  SHE GOT BEHIND IN HER RENT YESTERDAY THEY EVICTED HER  BUT FIRST  SHE HOISTED AN AMERICAN FLAG  ANDFROM UNDER ITS FOLDS SHE ANNOUNCED THAT BY VIRTUE OF ITS PROTECTION THEYCOULD NOT TURN HER OUT ON TO THE COLD STREET  WHAT WAS DONE  SHE WASARRESTED AND ARRAIGNED FOR INSANITY  TO DAY SHE WAS EXAMINED BY THEREGULAR INSANITY EXPERTS  SHE WAS FOUND INSANE  SHE WAS CONSIGNED TO THENAPA ASYLUM   BUT THAT IS FAR FETCHED   I OBJECTED   SUPPOSE I SHOULD DISAGREE WITHEVERYBODY ABOUT THE LITERARY STYLE OF A BOOK  THEY WOULDN T SEND ME TOAN ASYLUM FOR THAT   VERY TRUE   HE REPLIED   BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULDCONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY  THEREIN LIES THE DIFFERENCE  THEDIVERGENCE OF OPINION ON THE PARTS OF MARY MCKENNA AND THE BISHOP DOMENACE SOCIETY  WHAT IF ALL THE POOR PEOPLE SHOULD REFUSE TO PAY RENTAND SHELTER THEMSELVES UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG  LANDLORDISM WOULD GOCRUMBLING  THE BISHOP S VIEWS ARE JUST AS PERILOUS TO SOCIETY  ERGO  TOTHE ASYLUM WITH HIM  BUT STILL I REFUSED TO BELIEVE  WAIT AND SEE   ERNEST SAID  AND I WAITED NEXT MORNING I SENT OUT FOR ALL THE PAPERS  SO FAR ERNEST WAS RIGHT  NOTA WORD THAT BISHOP MOREHOUSE HAD UTTERED WAS IN PRINT  MENTION WAS MADEIN ONE OR TWO OF THE PAPERS THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERCOME BY HIS FEELINGS YET THE PLATITUDES OF THE SPEAKERS THAT FOLLOWED HIM WERE REPORTED ATLENGTH SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT HE HAD GONE AWAYON A VACATION TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF OVERWORK  SO FAR SO GOOD BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO HINT OF INSANITY  NOR EVEN OF NERVOUS COLLAPSE LITTLE DID I DREAM THE TERRIBLE ROAD THE BISHOP WAS DESTINED TOTRAVEL  THE GETHSEMANE AND CRUCIFIXION THAT ERNEST HAD PONDERED ABOUT CHAPTER VIIITHE MACHINE BREAKERSIT WAS JUST BEFORE ERNEST RAN FOR CONGRESS  ON THE SOCIALIST TICKET THAT FATHER GAVE WHAT HE PRIVATELY CALLED HIS  PROFIT AND LOSS  DINNER ERNEST CALLED IT THE DINNER OF THE MACHINE BREAKERS  IN POINT OF FACT IT WAS MERELY A DINNER FOR BUSINESS MEN  SMALL BUSINESS MEN  OFCOURSE  I DOUBT IF ONE OF THEM WAS INTERESTED IN ANY BUSINESS THE TOTALCAPITALIZATION OF WHICH EXCEEDED A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY WERE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE MIDDLE CLASS BUSINESS MEN THERE WAS OWEN  OF SILVERBERG  OWEN   COMPANY  A LARGE GROCERY FIRM WITHSEVERAL BRANCH STORES  WE BOUGHT OUR GROCERIES FROM THEM  THERE WEREBOTH PARTNERS OF THE BIG DRUG FIRM OF KOWALT   WASHBURN  AND MR ASMUNSEN  THE OWNER OF A LARGE GRANITE QUARRY IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND THERE WERE MANY SIMILAR MEN  OWNERS OR PART OWNERS IN SMALLFACTORIES  SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL INDUSTRIES  SMALL CAPITALISTS  INSHORT THEY WERE SHREWD FACED  INTERESTING MEN  AND THEY TALKED WITH SIMPLICITYAND CLEARNESS  THEIR UNANIMOUS COMPLAINT WAS AGAINST THE CORPORATIONSAND TRUSTS  THEIR CREED WAS   BUST THE TRUSTS   ALL OPPRESSIONORIGINATED IN THE TRUSTS  AND ONE AND ALL TOLD THE SAME TALE OF WOE THEY ADVOCATED GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF SUCH TRUSTS AS THE RAILROADSAND TELEGRAPHS  AND EXCESSIVE INCOME TAXES  GRADUATED WITH FEROCITY TO DESTROY LARGE ACCUMULATIONS  LIKEWISE THEY ADVOCATED  AS A CURE FORLOCAL ILLS  MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PUBLIC UTILITIES AS WATER  GAS TELEPHONES  AND STREET RAILWAYS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING WAS MR  ASMUNSEN S NARRATIVE OF HIS TRIBULATIONSAS A QUARRY OWNER  HE CONFESSED THAT HE NEVER MADE ANY PROFITS OUT OFHIS QUARRY  AND THIS  IN SPITE OF THE ENORMOUS VOLUME OF BUSINESSTHAT HAD BEEN CAUSED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF SAN FRANCISCO BY THE BIGEARTHQUAKE  FOR SIX YEARS THE REBUILDING OF SAN FRANCISCO HAD BEEN GOINGON  AND HIS BUSINESS HAD QUADRUPLED AND OCTUPLED  AND YET HE WAS NOBETTER OFF  THE RAILROAD KNOWS MY BUSINESS JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN I DO   HESAID   IT KNOWS MY OPERATING EXPENSES TO A CENT  AND IT KNOWS THE TERMSOF MY CONTRACTS  HOW IT KNOWS THESE THINGS I CAN ONLY GUESS  IT MUSTHAVE SPIES IN MY EMPLOY  AND IT MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THE PARTIES TO ALLMY CONTRACTS  FOR LOOK YOU  WHEN I PLACE A BIG CONTRACT  THE TERMSOF WHICH FAVOR ME A GOODLY PROFIT  THE FREIGHT RATE FROM MY QUARRY TOMARKET IS PROMPTLY RAISED  NO EXPLANATION IS MADE  THE RAILROAD GETS MYPROFIT  UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE NEVER SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THERAILROAD TO RECONSIDER ITS RAISE  ON THE OTHER HAND  WHEN THERE HAVEBEEN ACCIDENTS  INCREASED EXPENSES OF OPERATING  OR CONTRACTS WITH LESSPROFITABLE TERMS  I HAVE ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE RAILROAD TOLOWER ITS RATE  WHAT IS THE RESULT  LARGE OR SMALL  THE RAILROAD ALWAYSGETS MY PROFITS   WHAT REMAINS TO YOU OVER AND ABOVE   ERNEST INTERRUPTED TO ASK   WOULDROUGHLY BE THE EQUIVALENT OF YOUR SALARY AS A MANAGER DID THE RAILROADOWN THE QUARRY   THE VERY THING   MR  ASMUNSEN REPLIED   ONLY A SHORT TIME AGO I HAD MYBOOKS GONE THROUGH FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS  I DISCOVERED THAT FORTHOSE TEN YEARS MY GAIN WAS JUST EQUIVALENT TO A MANAGER S SALARY  THERAILROAD MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE OWNED MY QUARRY AND HIRED ME TO RUNIT   BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE   ERNEST LAUGHED   THE RAILROAD WOULD HAVE HADTO ASSUME ALL THE RISK WHICH YOU SO OBLIGINGLY ASSUMED FOR IT   VERY TRUE   MR  ASMUNSEN ANSWERED SADLY HAVING LET THEM HAVE THEY SAY  ERNEST BEGAN ASKING QUESTIONS RIGHT ANDLEFT  HE BEGAN WITH MR  OWEN  YOU STARTED A BRANCH STORE HERE IN BERKELEY ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO   YES   MR  OWEN ANSWERED  AND SINCE THEN I VE NOTICED THAT THREE LITTLE CORNER GROCERIES HAVEGONE OUT OF BUSINESS  WAS YOUR BRANCH STORE THE CAUSE OF IT  MR  OWEN AFFIRMED WITH A COMPLACENT SMILE   THEY HAD NO CHANCE AGAINSTUS   WHY NOT   WE HAD GREATER CAPITAL  WITH A LARGE BUSINESS THERE IS ALWAYS LESSWASTE AND GREATER EFFICIENCY   AND YOUR BRANCH STORE ABSORBED THE PROFITS OF THE THREE SMALL ONES  ISEE  BUT TELL ME  WHAT BECAME OF THE OWNERS OF THE THREE STORES   ONE IS DRIVING A DELIVERY WAGON FOR US  I DON T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TOTHE OTHER TWO  ERNEST TURNED ABRUPTLY ON MR  KOWALT  YOU SELL A GREAT DEAL AT CUT RATES   WHAT HAVE BECOME OF THE OWNERS OFTHE SMALL DRUG STORES THAT YOU FORCED TO THE WALL         A LOWERING OF SELLING PRICE TO COST  AND EVEN TO LESS THAN     COST  THUS  A LARGE COMPANY COULD SELL AT A LOSS FOR A     LONGER PERIOD THAN A SMALL COMPANY  AND SO DRIVE THE SMALL     COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS   A COMMON DEVICE OF COMPETITION  ONE OF THEM  MR  HAASFURTHER  HAS CHARGE NOW OF OUR PRESCRIPTIONDEPARTMENT   WAS THE ANSWER  AND YOU ABSORBED THE PROFITS THEY HAD BEEN MAKING   SURELY  THAT IS WHAT WE ARE IN BUSINESS FOR   AND YOU   ERNEST SAID SUDDENLY TO MR  ASMUNSEN   YOU ARE DISGUSTEDBECAUSE THE RAILROAD HAS ABSORBED YOUR PROFITS  MR  ASMUNSEN NODDED  WHAT YOU WANT IS TO MAKE PROFITS YOURSELF  AGAIN MR  ASMUNSEN NODDED  OUT OF OTHERS  THERE WAS NO ANSWER  OUT OF OTHERS   ERNEST INSISTED  THAT IS THE WAY PROFITS ARE MADE   MR  ASMUNSEN REPLIED CURTLY  THEN THE BUSINESS GAME IS TO MAKE PROFITS OUT OF OTHERS  AND TO PREVENTOTHERS FROM MAKING PROFITS OUT OF YOU  THAT S IT  ISN T IT  ERNEST HAD TO REPEAT HIS QUESTION BEFORE MR  ASMUNSEN GAVE AN ANSWER AND THEN HE SAID  YES  THAT S IT  EXCEPT THAT WE DO NOT OBJECT TO THE OTHERS MAKINGPROFITS SO LONG AS THEY ARE NOT EXTORTIONATE   BY EXTORTIONATE YOU MEAN LARGE  YET YOU DO NOT OBJECT TO MAKING LARGEPROFITS YOURSELF        SURELY NOT  AND MR  ASMUNSEN AMIABLY CONFESSED TO THE WEAKNESS  THERE WAS ONE OTHERMAN WHO WAS QUIZZED BY ERNEST AT THIS JUNCTURE  A MR  CALVIN  WHO HADONCE BEEN A GREAT DAIRY OWNER  SOME TIME AGO YOU WERE FIGHTING THE MILK TRUST   ERNEST SAID TO HIM  AND NOW YOU ARE IN GRANGE POLITICS   HOW DID IT HAPPEN         MANY EFFORTS WERE MADE DURING THIS PERIOD TO ORGANIZE THE     PERISHING FARMER CLASS INTO A POLITICAL PARTY  THE AIM OF     WHICH WAS DESTROY THE TRUSTS AND CORPORATIONS BY DRASTIC     LEGISLATION   ALL SUCH ATTEMPTS ENDED IN FAILURE  OH  I HAVEN T QUIT THE FIGHT   MR  CALVIN ANSWERED  AND HE LOOKEDBELLIGERENT ENOUGH   I M FIGHTING THE TRUST ON THE ONLY FIELD WHERE ITIS POSSIBLE TO FIGHT  THE POLITICAL FIELD  LET ME SHOW YOU  A FEW YEARSAGO WE DAIRYMEN HAD EVERYTHING OUR OWN WAY   BUT YOU COMPETED AMONG YOURSELVES   ERNEST INTERRUPTED  YES  THAT WAS WHAT KEPT THE PROFITS DOWN  WE DID TRY TO ORGANIZE  BUTINDEPENDENT DAIRYMEN ALWAYS BROKE THROUGH US  THEN CAME THE MILK TRUST   FINANCED BY SURPLUS CAPITAL FROM STANDARD OIL    ERNEST SAID        THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL GREAT TRUST  ALMOST A GENERATION IN     ADVANCE OF THE REST  YES   MR  CALVIN ACKNOWLEDGED   BUT WE DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME ITS AGENTS APPROACHED US WITH A CLUB   COME IN AND BE FAT   WAS THEIRPROPOSITION   OR STAY OUT AND STARVE   MOST OF US CAME IN  THOSE THATDIDN T  STARVED  OH  IT PAID US       AT FIRST  MILK WAS RAISED A CENT AQUART  ONE QUARTER OF THIS CENT CAME TO US  THREE QUARTERS OF IT WENT TOTHE TRUST  THEN MILK WAS RAISED ANOTHER CENT  ONLY WE DIDN T GET ANYOF THAT CENT  OUR COMPLAINTS WERE USELESS  THE TRUST WAS IN CONTROL  WEDISCOVERED THAT WE WERE PAWNS  FINALLY  THE ADDITIONAL QUARTER OF A CENTWAS DENIED US  THEN THE TRUST BEGAN TO SQUEEZE US OUT  WHAT COULD WE DO WE WERE SQUEEZED OUT  THERE WERE NO DAIRYMEN  ONLY A MILK TRUST   BUT WITH MILK TWO CENTS HIGHER  I SHOULD THINK YOU COULD HAVECOMPETED   ERNEST SUGGESTED SLYLY  SO WE THOUGHT  WE TRIED IT   MR  CALVIN PAUSED A MOMENT   IT BROKE US THE TRUST COULD PUT MILK UPON THE MARKET MORE CHEAPLY THAN WE  IT COULDSELL STILL AT A SLIGHT PROFIT WHEN WE WERE SELLING AT ACTUAL LOSS I DROPPED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THAT VENTURE  MOST OF US WENTBANKRUPT   THE DAIRYMEN WERE WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE         BANKRUPTCY  A PECULIAR INSTITUTION THAT ENABLED AN     INDIVIDUAL  WHO HAD FAILED IN COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY  TO     FOREGO PAYING HIS DEBTS  THE EFFECT WAS TO AMELIORATE THE     TOO SAVAGE CONDITIONS OF THE FANG AND CLAW SOCIAL STRUGGLE  SO THE TRUST TOOK YOUR PROFITS AWAY FROM YOU   ERNEST SAID   AND YOU VEGONE INTO POLITICS IN ORDER TO LEGISLATE THE TRUST OUT OF EXISTENCE ANDGET THE PROFITS BACK  MR  CALVIN S FACE LIGHTED UP   THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I SAY IN MYSPEECHES TO THE FARMERS  THAT S OUR WHOLE IDEA IN A NUTSHELL   AND YET THE TRUST PRODUCES MILK MORE CHEAPLY THAN COULD THE INDEPENDENTDAIRYMEN   ERNEST QUERIED  WHY SHOULDN T IT  WITH THE SPLENDID ORGANIZATION AND NEW MACHINERY ITSLARGE CAPITAL MAKES POSSIBLE   THERE IS NO DISCUSSION   ERNEST ANSWERED   IT CERTAINLY SHOULD  AND FURTHERMORE  IT DOES  MR  CALVIN HERE LAUNCHED OUT INTO A POLITICAL SPEECH IN EXPOSITION OFHIS VIEWS  HE WAS WARMLY FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER OF THE OTHERS  AND THE CRYOF ALL WAS TO DESTROY THE TRUSTS  POOR SIMPLE FOLK   ERNEST SAID TO ME IN AN UNDERTONE   THEY SEE CLEARLYAS FAR AS THEY SEE  BUT THEY SEE ONLY TO THE ENDS OF THEIR NOSES  A LITTLE LATER HE GOT THE FLOOR AGAIN  AND IN HIS CHARACTERISTIC WAYCONTROLLED IT FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING  I HAVE LISTENED CAREFULLY TO ALL OF YOU   HE BEGAN   AND I SEE PLAINLYTHAT YOU PLAY THE BUSINESS GAME IN THE ORTHODOX FASHION  LIFE SUMSITSELF UP TO YOU IN PROFITS  YOU HAVE A

TO COMBINATION  ANDFROM LITTLE COMBINATION TO LARGE COMBINATION  AND FROM LARGE COMBINATIONTO COLOSSAL COMBINATION  AND IT FLOWS ON TO SOCIALISM  WHICH IS THE MOSTCOLOSSAL COMBINATION OF ALL  YOU TELL ME THAT I DREAM  VERY GOOD  I LL GIVE YOU THE MATHEMATICSOF MY DREAM  AND HERE  IN ADVANCE  I CHALLENGE YOU TO SHOW THATMY MATHEMATICS ARE WRONG  I SHALL DEVELOP THE INEVITABILITY OFTHE BREAKDOWN OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM  AND I SHALL DEMONSTRATEMATHEMATICALLY WHY IT MUST BREAK DOWN  HERE GOES  AND BEAR WITH ME IF ATFIRST I SEEM IRRELEVANT  LET US  FIRST OF ALL  INVESTIGATE A PARTICULAR INDUSTRIAL PROCESS  ANDWHENEVER I STATE SOMETHING WITH WHICH YOU DISAGREE  PLEASE INTERRUPTME  HERE IS A SHOE FACTORY  THIS FACTORY TAKES LEATHER AND MAKES IT INTOSHOES  HERE IS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS  WORTH OF LEATHER  IT GOES THROUGHTHE FACTORY AND COMES OUT IN THE FORM OF SHOES  WORTH  LET US SAY  TWOHUNDRED DOLLARS  WHAT HAS HAPPENED  ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HAS BEEN ADDEDTO THE VALUE OF THE LEATHER  HOW WAS IT ADDED  LET US SEE  CAPITAL AND LABOR ADDED THIS VALUE OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS  CAPITALFURNISHED THE FACTORY  THE MACHINES  AND PAID ALL THE EXPENSES  LABORFURNISHED LABOR  BY THE JOINT EFFORT OF CAPITAL AND LABOR ONE HUNDREDDOLLARS OF VALUE WAS ADDED  ARE YOU ALL AGREED SO FAR  HEADS NODDED AROUND THE TABLE IN AFFIRMATION  LABOR AND CAPITAL HAVING PRODUCED THIS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS  NOW PROCEEDTO DIVIDE IT  THE STATISTICS OF THIS DIVISION ARE FRACTIONAL  SO LETUS  FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE  MAKE THEM ROUGHLY APPROXIMATE  CAPITALTAKES FIFTY DOLLARS AS ITS SHARE  AND LABOR GETS IN WAGES FIFTY DOLLARSAS ITS SHARE  WE WILL NOT ENTER INTO THE SQUABBLING OVER THE DIVISION  NO MATTER HOW MUCH SQUABBLING TAKES PLACE  IN ONE PERCENTAGE OR ANOTHERTHE DIVISION IS ARRANGED  AND TAKE NOTICE HERE  THAT WHAT IS TRUE OFTHIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRIAL PROCESS IS TRUE OF ALL INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AM I RIGHT         EVERHARD HERE CLEARLY DEVELOPS THE CAUSE OF ALL THE LABOR     TROUBLES OF THAT TIME   IN THE DIVISION OF THE JOINT PRODUCT      CAPITAL WANTED ALL IT COULD GET  AND LABOR WANTED     ALL IT COULD GET  THIS QUARREL OVER THE DIVISION WAS     IRRECONCILABLE   SO LONG AS THE SYSTEM OF CAPITALISTIC     PRODUCTION EXISTED  LABOR AND CAPITAL CONTINUED TO QUARREL     OVER THE DIVISION OF THE JOINT PRODUCT   IT IS A LUDICROUS     SPECTACLE TO US  BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT WE HAVE SEVEN     CENTURIES  ADVANTAGE OVER THOSE THAT LIVED IN THAT TIME AGAIN THE WHOLE TABLE AGREED WITH ERNEST  NOW  SUPPOSE LABOR  HAVING RECEIVED ITS FIFTY DOLLARS  WANTED TO BUYBACK SHOES  IT COULD ONLY BUY BACK FIFTY DOLLARS  WORTH  THAT S CLEAR ISN T IT  AND NOW WE SHIFT FROM THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS TO THE SUM TOTAL OF ALLINDUSTRIAL PROCESSES IN THE UNITED STATES  WHICH INCLUDES THE LEATHERITSELF  RAW MATERIAL  TRANSPORTATION  SELLING  EVERYTHING  WE WILL SAY FOR THE SAKE OF ROUND FIGURES  THAT THE TOTAL PRODUCTION OF WEALTH INTHE UNITED STATES IS ONE YEAR IS FOUR BILLION DOLLARS  THEN LABOR HASRECEIVED IN WAGES  DURING THE SAME PERIOD  TWO BILLION DOLLARS  FOURBILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN PRODUCED  HOW MUCH OF THIS CAN LABOR BUYBACK  TWO BILLIONS  THERE IS NO DISCUSSION OF THIS  I AM SURE  FOR THATMATTER  MY PERCENTAGES ARE MILD  BECAUSE OF A THOUSAND CAPITALISTICDEVICES  LABOR CANNOT BUY BACK EVEN HALF OF THE TOTAL PRODUCT  BUT TO RETURN  WE WILL SAY LABOR BUYS BACK TWO BILLIONS  THEN IT STANDSTO REASON THAT LABOR CAN CONSUME ONLY TWO BILLIONS  THERE ARE STILL TWOBILLIONS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR  WHICH LABOR CANNOT BUY BACK AND CONSUME   LABOR DOES NOT CONSUME ITS TWO BILLIONS  EVEN   MR  KOWALT SPOKE UP  IF IT DID  IT WOULD NOT HAVE ANY DEPOSITS IN THE SAVINGS BANKS   LABOR S DEPOSITS IN THE SAVINGS BANKS ARE ONLY A SORT OF RESERVE FUNDTHAT IS CONSUMED AS FAST AS IT ACCUMULATES  THESE DEPOSITS ARE SAVEDFOR OLD AGE  FOR SICKNESS AND ACCIDENT  AND FOR FUNERAL EXPENSES  THESAVINGS BANK DEPOSIT IS SIMPLY A PIECE OF THE LOAF PUT BACK ON THE SHELFTO BE EATEN NEXT DAY  NO  LABOR CONSUMES ALL OF THE TOTAL PRODUCT THATITS WAGES WILL BUY BACK  TWO BILLIONS ARE LEFT TO CAPITAL  AFTER IT HAS PAID ITS EXPENSES  DOESIT CONSUME THE REMAINDER  DOES CAPITAL CONSUME ALL OF ITS TWO BILLIONS  ERNEST STOPPED AND PUT THE QUESTION POINT BLANK TO A NUMBER OF THE MEN THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS  I DON T KNOW   ONE OF THEM FRANKLY SAID  OF COURSE YOU DO   ERNEST WENT ON   STOP AND THINK A MOMENT  IF CAPITALCONSUMED ITS SHARE  THE SUM TOTAL OF CAPITAL COULD NOT INCREASE  ITWOULD REMAIN CONSTANT  IF YOU WILL LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC HISTORY OFTHE UNITED STATES  YOU WILL SEE THAT THE SUM TOTAL OF CAPITAL HASCONTINUALLY INCREASED  THEREFORE CAPITAL DOES NOT CONSUME ITS SHARE  DOYOU REMEMBER WHEN ENGLAND OWNED SO MUCH OF OUR RAILROAD BONDS  AS THEYEARS WENT BY  WE BOUGHT BACK THOSE BONDS  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN  THATPART OF CAPITAL S UNCONSUMED SHARE BOUGHT BACK THE BONDS  WHAT IS THEMEANING OF THE FACT THAT TO DAY THE CAPITALISTS OF THE UNITED STATES OWNHUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MEXICAN BONDS  RUSSIANBONDS  ITALIAN BONDS  GRECIAN BONDS  THE MEANING IS THAT THOSE HUNDREDSAND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS WERE PART OF CAPITAL S SHARE WHICH CAPITALDID NOT CONSUME  FURTHERMORE  FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE CAPITALISTSYSTEM  CAPITAL HAS NEVER CONSUMED ALL OF ITS SHARE  AND NOW WE COME TO THE POINT  FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF WEALTH ISPRODUCED IN ONE YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES  LABOR BUYS BACK AND CONSUMESTWO BILLIONS  CAPITAL DOES NOT CONSUME THE REMAINING TWO BILLIONS  THEREIS A LARGE BALANCE LEFT OVER UNCONSUMED  WHAT IS DONE WITH THIS BALANCE WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT  LABOR CANNOT CONSUME ANY OF IT  FOR LABORHAS ALREADY SPENT ALL ITS WAGES  CAPITAL WILL NOT CONSUME THIS BALANCE BECAUSE  ALREADY  ACCORDING TO ITS NATURE  IT HAS CONSUMED ALL IT CAN AND STILL REMAINS THE BALANCE  WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT  WHAT IS DONEWITH IT   IT IS SOLD ABROAD   MR  KOWALT VOLUNTEERED  THE VERY THING   ERNEST AGREED   BECAUSE OF THIS BALANCE ARISES OURNEED FOR A FOREIGN MARKET  THIS IS SOLD ABROAD  IT HAS TO BE SOLDABROAD  THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GETTING RID OF IT  AND THAT UNCONSUMEDSURPLUS  SOLD ABROAD  BECOMES WHAT WE CALL OUR FAVORABLE BALANCE OFTRADE  ARE WE ALL AGREED SO FAR   SURELY IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO ELABORATE THESE A B C S OF COMMERCE  MR  CALVIN SAID TARTLY   WE ALL UNDERSTAND THEM   AND IT IS BY THESE A B C S I HAVE SO CAREFULLY ELABORATED THAT I SHALLCONFOUND YOU   ERNEST RETORTED   THERE S THE BEAUTY OF IT  AND I M GOINGTO CONFOUND YOU WITH THEM RIGHT NOW  HERE GOES  THE UNITED STATES IS A CAPITALIST COUNTRY THAT HAS DEVELOPED ITSRESOURCES  ACCORDING TO ITS CAPITALIST SYSTEM OF INDUSTRY  IT HAS ANUNCONSUMED SURPLUS THAT MUST BE GOT RID OF  AND THAT MUST BE GOT RIDOF ABROAD   WHAT IS TRUE OF THE UNITED STATES IS TRUE OF EVERY OTHERCAPITALIST COUNTRY WITH DEVELOPED RESOURCES  EVERY ONE OF SUCH COUNTRIESHAS AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  DON T FORGET THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY TRADEDWITH ONE ANOTHER  AND THAT THESE SURPLUSES YET REMAIN  LABOR IN ALLTHESE COUNTRIES HAS SPENT IT WAGES  AND CANNOT BUY ANY OF THE SURPLUSES CAPITAL IN ALL THESE COUNTRIES HAS ALREADY CONSUMED ALL IT IS ABLEACCORDING TO ITS NATURE  AND STILL REMAIN THE SURPLUSES  THEY CANNOTDISPOSE OF THESE SURPLUSES TO ONE ANOTHER  HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET RIDOF THEM         THEODORE ROOSEVELT  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A FEW     YEARS PRIOR TO THIS TIME  MADE THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC     DECLARATION   A MORE LIBERAL AND EXTENSIVE RECIPROCITY IN     THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF COMMODITIES IS NECESSARY  SO THAT     THE OVERPRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES CAN BE     SATISFACTORILY DISPOSED OF TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES    OF     COURSE  THIS OVERPRODUCTION HE MENTIONS WAS THE PROFITS OF     THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM OVER AND BEYOND THE CONSUMING POWER OF     THE CAPITALISTS   IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SENATOR MARK     HANNA SAID   THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH IN THE UNITED STATES     IS ONE THIRD LARGER ANNUALLY THAN ITS CONSUMPTION    ALSO A     FELLOW SENATOR  CHAUNCEY DEPEW  SAID   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE     PRODUCE ANNUALLY TWO BILLIONS MORE WEALTH THAN THEY     CONSUME   SELL THEM TO COUNTRIES WITH UNDEVELOPED RESOURCES   MR  KOWALTSUGGESTED  THE VERY THING  YOU SEE  MY ARGUMENT IS SO CLEAR AND SIMPLE THATIN YOUR OWN MINDS YOU CARRY IT ON FOR ME  AND NOW FOR THE NEXT STEP SUPPOSE THE UNITED STATES DISPOSES OF ITS SURPLUS TO A COUNTRY WITHUNDEVELOPED RESOURCES LIKE  SAY  BRAZIL  REMEMBER THIS SURPLUS IS OVERAND ABOVE TRADE  WHICH ARTICLES OF TRADE HAVE BEEN CONSUMED  WHAT  THEN DOES THE UNITED STATES GET IN RETURN FROM BRAZIL   GOLD   SAID MR  KOWALT  BUT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH GOLD  AND NOT MUCH OF IT  IN THE WORLD  ERNEST OBJECTED  GOLD IN THE FORM OF SECURITIES AND BONDS AND SO FORTH   MR  KOWALTAMENDED  NOW YOU VE STRUCK IT   ERNEST SAID   FROM BRAZIL THE UNITED STATES  INRETURN FOR HER SURPLUS  GETS BONDS AND SECURITIES  AND WHAT DOES THATMEAN  IT MEANS THAT THE UNITED STATES IS COMING TO OWN RAILROADS INBRAZIL  FACTORIES  MINES  AND LANDS IN BRAZIL  AND WHAT IS THE MEANINGOF THAT IN TURN  MR  KOWALT PONDERED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD  I LL TELL YOU   ERNEST CONTINUED   IT MEANS THAT THE RESOURCES OFBRAZIL ARE BEING DEVELOPED  AND NOW  THE NEXT POINT  WHEN BRAZIL  UNDERTHE CAPITALIST SYSTEM  HAS DEVELOPED HER RESOURCES  SHE WILL HERSELFHAVE AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  CAN SHE GET RID OF THIS SURPLUS TO THEUNITED STATES  NO  BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS HERSELF A SURPLUS  CANTHE UNITED STATES DO WHAT SHE PREVIOUSLY DID  GET RID OF HER SURPLUS TOBRAZIL  NO  FOR BRAZIL NOW HAS A SURPLUS  TOO  WHAT HAPPENS  THE UNITED STATES AND BRAZIL MUST BOTH SEEK OUT OTHERCOUNTRIES WITH UNDEVELOPED RESOURCES  IN ORDER TO UNLOAD THE SURPLUSESON THEM  BUT BY THE VERY PROCESS OF UNLOADING THE SURPLUSES  THERESOURCES OF THOSE COUNTRIES ARE IN TURN DEVELOPED  SOON THEY HAVESURPLUSES  AND ARE SEEKING OTHER COUNTRIES ON WHICH TO UNLOAD  NOW GENTLEMEN  FOLLOW ME  THE PLANET IS ONLY SO LARGE  THERE ARE ONLY SOMANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD  WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN EVERY COUNTRY INTHE WORLD  DOWN TO THE SMALLEST AND LAST  WITH A SURPLUS IN ITS HANDS STANDS CONFRONTING EVERY OTHER COUNTRY WITH SURPLUSES IN THEIR HANDS  HE PAUSED AND REGARDED HIS LISTENERS  THE BEPUZZLEMENT IN THEIR FACESWAS DELICIOUS  ALSO  THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES  OUT OF ABSTRACTIONSERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT  THEY WERE SEEING ITTHEN  AS THEY SAT THERE  AND THEY WERE FRIGHTENED BY IT  WE STARTED WITH A B C  MR  CALVIN   ERNEST SAID SLYLY   I HAVE NOWGIVEN YOU THE REST OF THE ALPHABET  IT IS VERY SIMPLE  THAT IS THEBEAUTY OF IT  YOU SURELY HAVE THE ANSWER FORTHCOMING  WHAT  THEN  WHENEVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  WHERE WILL YOURCAPITALIST SYSTEM BE THEN  BUT MR  CALVIN SHOOK A TROUBLED HEAD  HE WAS OBVIOUSLY QUESTING BACKTHROUGH ERNEST S REASONING IN SEARCH OF AN ERROR  LET ME BRIEFLY GO OVER THE GROUND WITH YOU AGAIN   ERNEST SAID   WEBEGAN WITH A PARTICULAR INDUSTRIAL PROCESS  THE SHOE FACTORY  WE FOUNDTHAT THE DIVISION OF THE JOINT PRODUCT THAT TOOK PLACE THERE WAS SIMILARTO THE DIVISION THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL INDUSTRIALPROCESSES  WE FOUND THAT LABOR COULD BUY BACK WITH ITS WAGES ONLYSO MUCH OF THE PRODUCT  AND THAT CAPITAL DID NOT CONSUME ALL OF THEREMAINDER OF THE PRODUCT  WE FOUND THAT WHEN LABOR HAD CONSUMED TO THEFULL EXTENT OF ITS WAGES  AND WHEN CAPITAL HAD CONSUMED ALL IT WANTED THERE WAS STILL LEFT AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  WE AGREED THAT THIS SURPLUSCOULD ONLY BE DISPOSED OF ABROAD  WE AGREED  ALSO  THAT THE EFFECTOF UNLOADING THIS SURPLUS ON ANOTHER COUNTRY WOULD BE TO DEVELOP THERESOURCES OF THAT COUNTRY  AND THAT IN A SHORT TIME THAT COUNTRYWOULD HAVE AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  WE EXTENDED THIS PROCESS TO ALL THECOUNTRIES ON THE PLANET  TILL EVERY COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING EVERY YEAR AND EVERY DAY  AN UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  WHICH IT COULD DISPOSE OF TO NOOTHER COUNTRY  AND NOW I ASK YOU AGAIN  WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITHTHOSE SURPLUSES  STILL NO ONE ANSWERED  MR  CALVIN   ERNEST QUERIED  IT BEATS ME   MR  CALVIN CONFESSED  I NEVER DREAMED OF SUCH A THING   MR  ASMUNSEN SAID   AND YET IT DOESSEEM CLEAR AS PRINT  IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER HEARD KARL MARX S  DOCTRINE OF SURPLUSVALUE ELABORATED  AND ERNEST HAD DONE IT SO SIMPLY THAT I  TOO  SATPUZZLED AND DUMBFOUNDED        KARL MARX  THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL HERO OF SOCIALISM   A     GERMAN JEW OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY   A CONTEMPORARY OF     JOHN STUART MILL  IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE TO US THAT WHOLE     GENERATIONS SHOULD HAVE ELAPSED AFTER THE ENUNCIATION OF     MARX S ECONOMIC DISCOVERIES  IN WHICH TIME HE WAS SNEERED AT     BY THE WORLD S ACCEPTED THINKERS AND SCHOLARS   BECAUSE OF     HIS DISCOVERIES HE WAS BANISHED FROM HIS NATIVE COUNTRY  AND     HE DIED AN EXILE IN ENGLAND  I LL TELL YOU A WAY TO GET RID OF THE SURPLUS   ERNEST SAID   THROW ITINTO THE SEA  THROW EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS  WORTHOF SHOES AND WHEAT AND CLOTHING AND ALL THE COMMODITIES OF COMMERCE INTOTHE SEA  WON T THAT FIX IT   IT WILL CERTAINLY FIX IT   MR  CALVIN ANSWERED   BUT IT IS ABSURD FORYOU TO TALK THAT WAY  ERNEST WAS UPON HIM LIKE A FLASH  IS IT A BIT MORE ABSURD THAN WHAT YOU ADVOCATE  YOU MACHINE BREAKER RETURNING TO THE ANTEDILUVIAN WAYS OF YOUR FOREFATHERS  WHAT DO YOUPROPOSE IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THE SURPLUS  YOU WOULD ESCAPE THE PROBLEMOF THE SURPLUS BY NOT PRODUCING ANY SURPLUS  AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSETO AVOID PRODUCING A SURPLUS  BY RETURNING TO A PRIMITIVE METHOD OFPRODUCTION  SO CONFUSED AND DISORDERLY AND IRRATIONAL  SO WASTEFUL ANDCOSTLY  THAT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PRODUCE A SURPLUS  MR  CALVIN SWALLOWED  THE POINT HAD BEEN DRIVEN HOME  HE SWALLOWED AGAINAND CLEARED HIS THROAT  YOU ARE RIGHT   HE SAID   I STAND CONVICTED  IT IS ABSURD  BUT WE VEGOT TO DO SOMETHING  IT IS A CASE OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR US OF THE MIDDLECLASS  WE REFUSE TO PERISH  WE ELECT TO BE ABSURD AND TO RETURN TO THETRULY CRUDE AND WASTEFUL METHODS OF OUR FOREFATHERS  WE WILL PUT BACKINDUSTRY TO ITS PRE TRUST STAGE  WE WILL BREAK THE MACHINES  AND WHATARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT   BUT YOU CAN T BREAK THE MACHINES   ERNEST REPLIED   YOU CANNOT MAKE THETIDE OF EVOLUTION FLOW BACKWARD  OPPOSED TO YOU ARE TWO GREAT FORCES EACH OF WHICH IS MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU OF THE MIDDLE CLASS  THE LARGECAPITALISTS  THE TRUSTS  IN SHORT  WILL NOT LET YOU TURN BACK  THEYDON T WANT THE MACHINES DESTROYED  AND GREATER THAN THE TRUSTS  ANDMORE POWERFUL  IS LABOR  IT WILL NOT LET YOU DESTROY THE MACHINES  THEOWNERSHIP OF THE WORLD  ALONG WITH THE MACHINES  LIES BETWEEN THETRUSTS AND LABOR  THAT IS THE BATTLE ALIGNMENT  NEITHER SIDE WANTSTHE DESTRUCTION OF THE MACHINES  BUT EACH SIDE WANTS TO POSSESS THEMACHINES  IN THIS BATTLE THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS NO PLACE  THE MIDDLE CLASSIS A PYGMY BETWEEN TWO GIANTS  DON T YOU SEE  YOU POOR PERISHING MIDDLECLASS  YOU ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN THE UPPER AND NETHER MILLSTONES  AND EVENNOW HAS THE GRINDING BEGUN  I HAVE DEMONSTRATED TO YOU MATHEMATICALLY THE INEVITABLE BREAKDOWN OFTHE CAPITALIST SYSTEM  WHEN EVERY COUNTRY STANDS WITH AN UNCONSUMED ANDUNSALABLE SURPLUS ON ITS HANDS  THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM WILL BREAK DOWNUNDER THE TERRIFIC STRUCTURE OF PROFITS THAT IT ITSELF HAS REARED  ANDIN THAT DAY THERE WON T BE ANY DESTRUCTION OF THE MACHINES  THE STRUGGLETHEN WILL BE FOR THE OWNERSHIP OF THE MACHINES  IF LABOR WINS  YOUR WAYWILL BE EASY  THE UNITED STATES  AND THE WHOLE WORLD FOR THAT MATTER WILL ENTER UPON A NEW AND TREMENDOUS ERA  INSTEAD OF BEING CRUSHED BYTHE MACHINES  LIFE WILL BE MADE FAIRER  AND HAPPIER  AND NOBLER BYTHEM  YOU OF THE DESTROYED MIDDLE CLASS  ALONG WITH LABOR  THERE WILLBE NOTHING BUT LABOR THEN  SO YOU  AND ALL THE REST OF LABOR  WILLPARTICIPATE IN THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRODUCTS OF THEWONDERFUL MACHINES  AND WE  ALL OF US  WILL MAKE NEW AND MORE WONDERFULMACHINES  AND THERE WON T BE ANY UNCONSUMED SURPLUS  BECAUSE THERE WON TBE ANY PROFITS   BUT SUPPOSE THE TRUSTS WIN IN THIS BATTLE OVER THE OWNERSHIP OF THEMACHINES AND THE WORLD   MR  KOWALT ASKED  THEN   ERNEST ANSWERED   YOU  AND LABOR  AND ALL OF US  WILL BE CRUSHEDUNDER THE IRON HEEL OF A DESPOTISM AS RELENTLESS AND TERRIBLE AS ANYDESPOTISM THAT HAS BLACKENED THE PAGES OF THE HISTORY OF MAN  THAT WILLBE A GOOD NAME FOR THAT DESPOTISM  THE IRON HEEL          THE EARLIEST KNOWN USE OF THAT NAME TO DESIGNATE THE     OLIGARCHY THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE  AND EVERY MAN AT THE TABLE MEDITATED IN WAYSUNWONTED AND PROFOUND  BUT THIS SOCIALISM OF YOURS IS A DREAM   MR  CALVIN SAID  AND REPEATED  A DREAM   I LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT ISN T A DREAM  THEN   ERNEST ANSWERED  AND THAT SOMETHING I SHALL CALL THE OLIGARCHY  YOU CALL IT THEPLUTOCRACY  WE BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING  THE LARGE CAPITALISTS OR THETRUSTS  LET US SEE WHERE THE POWER LIES TODAY  AND IN ORDER TO DO SO LET US APPORTION SOCIETY INTO ITS CLASS DIVISIONS  THERE ARE THREE BIG CLASSES IN SOCIETY  FIRST COMES THE PLUTOCRACY WHICH IS COMPOSED OF WEALTHY BANKERS  RAILWAY MAGNATES  CORPORATIONDIRECTORS  AND TRUST MAGNATES  SECOND  IS THE MIDDLE CLASS  YOUR CLASS GENTLEMEN  WHICH IS COMPOSED OF FARMERS  MERCHANTS  SMALL MANUFACTURERS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN  AND THIRD AND LAST COMES MY CLASS  THEPROLETARIAT  WHICH IS COMPOSED OF THE WAGE WORKERS         THIS DIVISION OF SOCIETY MADE BY EVERHARD IS IN ACCORDANCE     WITH THAT MADE BY LUCIEN SANIAL  ONE OF THE STATISTICAL     AUTHORITIES OF THAT TIME   HIS CALCULATION OF THE MEMBERSHIP     OF THESE DIVISIONS BY OCCUPATION  FROM THE UNITED STATES     CENSUS OF       IS AS FOLLOWS  PLUTOCRATIC CLASS               MIDDLE CLASS             AND PROLETARIAT CLASS              YOU CANNOT BUT GRANT THAT THE OWNERSHIP OF WEALTH CONSTITUTES ESSENTIALPOWER IN THE UNITED STATES TO DAY  HOW IS THIS WEALTH OWNED BY THESETHREE CLASSES  HERE ARE THE FIGURES  THE PLUTOCRACY OWNS SIXTY SEVENBILLIONS OF WEALTH  OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS ENGAGED INOCCUPATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES  ONLY NINE TENTHS OF ONE PER CENT AREFROM THE PLUTOCRACY  YET THE PLUTOCRACY OWNS SEVENTY PER CENT OF THETOTAL WEALTH  THE MIDDLE CLASS OWNS TWENTY FOUR BILLIONS  TWENTY NINEPER CENT OF THOSE IN OCCUPATIONS ARE FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS  AND THEY OWNTWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL WEALTH  REMAINS THE PROLETARIAT  ITOWNS FOUR BILLIONS  OF ALL PERSONS IN OCCUPATIONS  SEVENTY PER CENTCOME FROM THE PROLETARIAT  AND THE PROLETARIAT OWNS FOUR PER CENT OF THETOTAL WEALTH  WHERE DOES THE POWER LIE  GENTLEMEN   FROM YOUR OWN FIGURES  WE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS ARE MORE POWERFUL THANLABOR   MR  ASMUNSEN REMARKED  CALLING US WEAK DOES NOT MAKE YOU STRONGER IN THE FACE OF THE STRENGTHOF THE PLUTOCRACY   ERNEST RETORTED   AND FURTHERMORE  I M NOT DONE WITHYOU  THERE IS A GREATER STRENGTH THAN WEALTH  AND IT IS GREATER BECAUSEIT CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY  OUR STRENGTH  THE STRENGTH OF THE PROLETARIAT IS IN OUR MUSCLES  IN OUR HANDS TO CAST BALLOTS  IN OUR FINGERS TO PULLTRIGGERS  THIS STRENGTH WE CANNOT BE STRIPPED OF  IT IS THE PRIMITIVESTRENGTH  IT IS THE STRENGTH THAT IS TO LIFE GERMANE  IT IS THE STRENGTHTHAT IS STRONGER THAN WEALTH  AND THAT WEALTH CANNOT TAKE AWAY  BUT YOUR STRENGTH IS DETACHABLE  IT CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU  EVENNOW THE PLUTOCRACY IS TAKING IT AWAY FROM YOU  IN THE END IT WILL TAKEIT ALL AWAY FROM YOU  AND THEN YOU WILL CEASE TO BE THE MIDDLE CLASS YOU WILL DESCEND TO US  YOU WILL BECOME PROLETARIANS  AND THE BEAUTY OFIT IS THAT YOU WILL THEN ADD TO OUR STRENGTH  WE WILL HAIL YOU BROTHERS AND WE WILL FIGHT SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY  YOU SEE  LABOR HAS NOTHING CONCRETE OF WHICH TO BE DESPOILED  ITSSHARE OF THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY CONSISTS OF CLOTHES AND HOUSEHOLDFURNITURE  WITH HERE AND THERE  IN VERY RARE CASES  AN UNENCUMBEREDHOME  BUT YOU HAVE THE CONCRETE WEALTH  TWENTY FOUR BILLIONS OF IT  ANDTHE PLUTOCRACY WILL TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU  OF COURSE  THERE IS THE LARGELIKELIHOOD THAT THE PROLETARIAT WILL TAKE IT AWAY FIRST  DON T YOUSEE YOUR POSITION  GENTLEMEN  THE MIDDLE CLASS IS A WOBBLY LITTLE LAMBBETWEEN A LION AND A TIGER  IF ONE DOESN T GET YOU  THE OTHER WILL  ANDIF THE PLUTOCRACY GETS YOU FIRST  WHY IT S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME WHENTHE PROLETARIAT GETS THE PLUTOCRACY  EVEN YOUR PRESENT WEALTH IS NOT A TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR POWER  THESTRENGTH OF YOUR WEALTH AT THIS MOMENT IS ONLY AN EMPTY SHELL  THAT ISWHY YOU ARE CRYING OUT YOUR FEEBLE LITTLE BATTLE CRY   RETURN TO THEWAYS OF OUR FATHERS   YOU ARE AWARE OF YOUR IMPOTENCY  YOU KNOW THATYOUR STRENGTH IS AN EMPTY SHELL  AND I LL SHOW YOU THE EMPTINESS OF IT  WHAT POWER HAVE THE FARMERS  OVER FIFTY PER CENT ARE THRALLS BY VIRTUEOF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE MERELY TENANTS OR ARE MORTGAGED  AND ALL OFTHEM ARE THRALLS BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THE TRUSTS ALREADY OWN ORCONTROL  WHICH IS THE SAME THING ONLY BETTER   OWN AND CONTROL ALLTHE MEANS OF MARKETING THE CROPS  SUCH AS COLD STORAGE  RAILROADS ELEVATORS  AND STEAMSHIP LINES  AND  FURTHERMORE  THE TRUSTS CONTROLTHE MARKETS  IN ALL THIS THE FARMERS ARE WITHOUT POWER  AS REGARDS THEIRPOLITICAL AND GOVERNMENTAL POWER  I LL TAKE THAT UP LATER  ALONG WITHTHE POLITICAL AND GOVERNMENTAL POWER OF THE WHOLE MIDDLE CLASS  DAY BY DAY THE TRUSTS SQUEEZE OUT THE FARMERS AS THEY SQUEEZED OUT MR CALVIN AND THE REST OF THE DAIRYMEN  AND DAY BY DAY ARE THE MERCHANTSSQUEEZED OUT IN THE SAME WAY  DO YOU REMEMBER HOW  IN SIX MONTHS  THETOBACCO TRUST SQUEEZED OUT OVER FOUR HUNDRED CIGAR STORES IN NEW YORKCITY ALONE  WHERE ARE THE OLD TIME OWNERS OF THE COAL FIELDS  YOU KNOWTODAY  WITHOUT MY TELLING YOU  THAT THE RAILROAD TRUST OWNS OR CONTROLSTHE ENTIRE ANTHRACITE AND BITUMINOUS COAL FIELDS  DOESN T THE STANDARDOIL TRUST  OWN A SCORE OF THE OCEAN LINES  AND DOES IT NOT ALSO CONTROLCOPPER  TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING A SMELTER TRUST AS A LITTLE SIDEENTERPRISE  THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES TO NIGHTLIGHTED BY THE COMPANIES OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY STANDARD OIL  AND INAS MANY CITIES ALL THE ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION   URBAN  SUBURBAN  ANDINTERURBAN   IS IN THE HANDS OF STANDARD OIL  THE SMALL CAPITALISTS WHOWERE IN THESE THOUSANDS OF ENTERPRISES ARE GONE  YOU KNOW THAT  IT S THESAME WAY THAT YOU ARE GOING        STANDARD OIL AND ROCKEFELLER  SEE UPCOMING FOOTNOTE       ROCKEFELLER BEGAN AS A MEMBER        THE SMALL MANUFACTURER IS LIKE THE FARMER  AND SMALL MANUFACTURERSAND FARMERS TO DAY ARE REDUCED  TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES  TO FEUDALTENURE  FOR THAT MATTER  THE PROFESSIONAL MEN AND THE ARTISTS AREAT THIS PRESENT MOMENT VILLEINS IN EVERYTHING BUT NAME  WHILE THEPOLITICIANS ARE HENCHMEN  WHY DO YOU  MR  CALVIN  WORK ALL YOUR NIGHTSAND DAYS TO ORGANIZE THE FARMERS  ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE MIDDLECLASS  INTO A NEW POLITICAL PARTY  BECAUSE THE POLITICIANS OF THE OLDPARTIES WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR ATAVISTIC IDEAS  AND WITH YOURATAVISTIC IDEAS  THEY WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO BECAUSE THEY ARE WHAT ISAID THEY ARE  HENCHMEN  RETAINERS OF THE PLUTOCRACY  I SPOKE OF THE PROFESSIONAL MEN AND THE ARTISTS AS VILLEINS  WHAT ELSEARE THEY  ONE AND ALL  THE PROFESSORS  THE PREACHERS  AND THE EDITORS HOLD THEIR JOBS BY SERVING THE PLUTOCRACY  AND THEIR SERVICE CONSISTS OFPROPAGATING ONLY SUCH IDEAS AS ARE EITHER HARMLESS TO OR COMMENDATORYOF THE PLUTOCRACY  WHENEVER THEY PROPAGATE IDEAS THAT MENACE THEPLUTOCRACY  THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS  IN WHICH CASE  IF THEY HAVE NOTPROVIDED FOR THE RAINY DAY  THEY DESCEND INTO THE PROLETARIAT AND EITHERPERISH OR BECOME WORKING CLASS AGITATORS  AND DON T FORGET THAT IT ISTHE PRESS  THE PULPIT  AND THE UNIVERSITY THAT MOULD PUBLIC OPINION  SETTHE THOUGHT PACE OF THE NATION  AS FOR THE ARTISTS  THEY MERELY PANDERTO THE LITTLE LESS THAN IGNOBLE TASTES OF THE PLUTOCRACY  BUT AFTER ALL  WEALTH IN ITSELF IS NOT THE REAL POWER  IT IS THE MEANSTO POWER  AND POWER IS GOVERNMENTAL  WHO CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT TO DAY THE PROLETARIAT WITH ITS TWENTY MILLIONS ENGAGED IN OCCUPATIONS  EVENYOU LAUGH AT THE IDEA  DOES THE MIDDLE CLASS  WITH ITS EIGHT MILLIONOCCUPIED MEMBERS  NO MORE THAN THE PROLETARIAT  WHO  THEN  CONTROLSTHE GOVERNMENT  THE PLUTOCRACY  WITH ITS PALTRY QUARTER OF A MILLIONOF OCCUPIED MEMBERS  BUT THIS QUARTER OF A MILLION DOES NOT CONTROL THEGOVERNMENT  THOUGH IT RENDERS YEOMAN SERVICE  IT IS THE BRAIN OF THEPLUTOCRACY THAT CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT  AND THIS BRAIN CONSISTS OFSEVEN  SMALL AND POWERFUL GROUPS OF MEN  AND DO NOT FORGET THAT THESEGROUPS ARE WORKING TO DAY PRACTICALLY IN UNISON        EVEN AS LATE AS       IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT ELEVEN GROUPS     DOMINATED THE COUNTRY  BUT THIS NUMBER WAS REDUCED BY THE     AMALGAMATION OF THE FIVE RAILROAD GROUPS INTO A SUPREME     COMBINATION OF ALL THE RAILROADS   THESE FIVE GROUPS SO     AMALGAMATED

SHOW HOW THE NEED FOR REINVESTMENT     OF THE STANDARD OIL SURPLUS CRUSHED OUT SMALL CAPITALISTS     AND HASTENED THE BREAKDOWN OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM   DAVID     GRAHAM PHILLIPS WAS A RADICAL WRITER OF THE PERIOD  AND THE     QUOTATION  BY HIM  IS TAKEN FROM A COPY OF THE SATURDAY     EVENING POST  DATED OCTOBER         A D   THIS IS THE ONLY     COPY OF THIS PUBLICATION THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US  AND YET      FROM ITS APPEARANCE AND CONTENT  WE CANNOT BUT CONCLUDE THAT     IT WAS ONE OF THE POPULAR PERIODICALS WITH A LARGE     CIRCULATION   THE QUOTATION HERE FOLLOWS       ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO ROCKEFELLER S INCOME WAS GIVEN AS     THIRTY MILLIONS BY AN EXCELLENT AUTHORITY   HE HAD REACHED     THE LIMIT OF PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF PROFITS IN THE OIL     INDUSTRY   HERE  THEN  WERE

BEGAN TO BRANCH OUT FROM OIL INTO OTHER THINGS   THEY WERE     FORCED  SWEPT ON BY THIS INROLLING TIDE OF WEALTH WHICH     THEIR MONOPOLY MAGNET IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED   THEY     DEVELOPED A STAFF OF INVESTMENT SEEKERS AND INVESTIGATORS      IT IS SAID THAT THE CHIEF OF THIS STAFF HAS A SALARY OF              A YEAR       THE FIRST CONSPICUOUS EXCURSION AND INCURSION OF THE     ROCKEFELLERS WAS INTO THE RAILWAY FIELD   BY      THEY     CONTROLLED ONE FIFTH OF THE RAILWAY MILEAGE OF THE COUNTRY      WHAT DO THEY OWN OR  THROUGH DOMINANT OWNERSHIP  CONTROL     TO DAY   THEY ARE POWERFUL IN ALL THE GREAT RAILWAYS OF NEW     YORK  NORTH  EAST  AND WEST  EXCEPT ONE  WHERE THEIR SHARE     IS ONLY A FEW MILLIONS   THEY ARE IN MOST OF THE GREAT     RAILWAYS RADIATING FROM CHICAGO   THEY DOMINATE IN SEVERAL     OF THE SYSTEMS THAT EXTEND TO THE PACIFIC   IT IS THEIR     VOTES THAT MAKE MR  MORGAN SO POTENT  THOUGH  IT MAY BE     ADDED  THEY NEED HIS BRAINS MORE THAN HE NEEDS THEIR VOTES       AT PRESENT  AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO CONSTITUTES IN     LARGE MEASURE THE  COMMUNITY OF INTEREST        BUT RAILWAYS COULD NOT ALONE ABSORB RAPIDLY ENOUGH THOSE     MIGHTY FLOODS OF GOLD   PRESENTLY JOHN D  ROCKEFELLER S                A MONTH HAD INCREASED TO FOUR  TO FIVE  TO SIX     MILLIONS A MONTH  TO             A YEAR   ILLUMINATING OIL     WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT   THE REINVESTMENTS OF INCOME WERE     ADDING THEIR MITE OF MANY ANNUAL MILLIONS       THE ROCKEFELLERS WENT INTO GAS AND ELECTRICITY WHEN THOSE     INDUSTRIES HAD DEVELOPED TO THE SAFE INVESTMENT STAGE   AND     NOW A LARGE PART OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MUST BEGIN TO ENRICH     THE ROCKEFELLERS AS SOON AS THE SUN GOES DOWN  NO MATTER     WHAT FORM OF ILLUMINANT THEY USE   THEY WENT INTO FARM     MORTGAGES   IT IS SAID THAT WHEN PROSPERITY A FEW YEARS AGO     ENABLED THE FARMERS TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR MORTGAGES      JOHN D  ROCKEFELLER WAS MOVED ALMOST TO TEARS  EIGHT     MILLIONS WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT TAKEN CARE OF FOR YEARS TO     COME AT A GOOD INTEREST WERE SUDDENLY DUMPED UPON HIS     DOORSTEP AND THERE SET UP A SQUAWKING FOR A NEW HOME   THIS     UNEXPECTED ADDITION TO HIS WORRIMENTS IN FINDING PLACES FOR     THE PROGENY OF HIS PETROLEUM AND THEIR PROGENY AND THEIR     PROGENY S PROGENY WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE EQUANIMITY OF A MAN     WITHOUT A DIGESTION             THE ROCKEFELLERS WENT INTO MINES  IRON AND COAL AND COPPER     AND LEAD  INTO OTHER INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES  INTO STREET     RAILWAYS  INTO NATIONAL  STATE  AND MUNICIPAL BONDS  INTO     STEAMSHIPS AND STEAMBOATS AND TELEGRAPHY  INTO REAL ESTATE      INTO SKYSCRAPERS AND RESIDENCES AND HOTELS AND BUSINESS     BLOCKS  INTO LIFE INSURANCE  INTO BANKING   THERE WAS SOON     LITERALLY NO FIELD OF INDUSTRY WHERE THEIR MILLIONS WERE NOT     AT WORK             THE ROCKEFELLER BANK  THE NATIONAL CITY BANK  IS BY ITSELF     FAR AND AWAY THE BIGGEST BANK IN THE UNITED STATES   IT IS     EXCEEDED IN THE WORLD ONLY BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE     BANK OF FRANCE   THE DEPOSITS AVERAGE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED     MILLIONS A DAY  AND IT DOMINATES THE CALL LOAN MARKET ON     WALL STREET AND THE STOCK MARKET  BUT IT IS NOT ALONE  IT IS     THE HEAD OF THE ROCKEFELLER CHAIN OF BANKS  WHICH INCLUDES     FOURTEEN BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES IN NEW YORK CITY  AND     BANKS OF GREAT STRENGTH AND INFLUENCE IN EVERY LARGE MONEY     CENTER IN THE COUNTRY       JOHN D  ROCKEFELLER OWNS STANDARD OIL STOCK WORTH BETWEEN     FOUR AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLIONS AT THE MARKET QUOTATIONS   HE     HAS A HUNDRED MILLIONS IN THE STEEL TRUST  ALMOST AS MUCH IN     A SINGLE WESTERN RAILWAY SYSTEM  HALF AS MUCH IN A SECOND      AND SO ON AND ON AND ON UNTIL THE MIND WEARIES OF THE     CATALOGUING   HIS INCOME LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT                    IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THE INCOMES OF ALL THE ROTHSCHILDS     TOGETHER MAKE A GREATER SUM   AND IT IS GOING UP BY LEAPS     AND BOUNDS       LITTLE DISCUSSION TOOK PLACE AFTER THIS  AND THE DINNER SOON BROKE     UP   ALL WERE QUIET AND SUBDUED  AND LEAVE TAKING WAS DONE WITH LOW     VOICES   IT SEEMED ALMOST THAT THEY WERE SCARED BY THE VISION OF     THE TIMES THEY HAD SEEN       THE SITUATION IS  INDEED  SERIOUS   MR  CALVIN SAID TO ERNEST    I     HAVE LITTLE QUARREL WITH THE WAY YOU HAVE DEPICTED IT   ONLY I     DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE DOOM OF THE MIDDLE CLASS   WE SHALL     SURVIVE  AND WE SHALL OVERTHROW THE TRUSTS        AND RETURN TO THE WAYS OF YOUR FATHERS   ERNEST FINISHED FOR HIM       EVEN SO   MR  CALVIN ANSWERED GRAVELY    I KNOW IT S A SORT OF     MACHINE BREAKING  AND THAT IT IS ABSURD   BUT THEN LIFE SEEMS     ABSURD TO DAY  WHAT OF THE MACHINATIONS OF THE PLUTOCRACY   AND AT     ANY RATE  OUR SORT OF MACHINE BREAKING IS AT LEAST PRACTICAL AND     POSSIBLE  WHICH YOUR DREAM IS NOT   YOUR SOCIALISTIC DREAM IS           WELL  A DREAM   WE CANNOT FOLLOW YOU        I ONLY WISH YOU FELLOWS KNEW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT EVOLUTION     AND SOCIOLOGY   ERNEST SAID WISTFULLY  AS THEY SHOOK HANDS    WE     WOULD BE SAVED SO MUCH TROUBLE IF YOU DID  CHAPTER XTHE VORTEXFOLLOWING LIKE THUNDER CLAPS UPON THE BUSINESS MEN S DINNER  OCCURREDEVENT AFTER EVENT OF TERRIFYING MOMENT  AND I  LITTLE I  WHO HAD LIVEDSO PLACIDLY ALL MY DAYS IN THE QUIET UNIVERSITY TOWN  FOUND MYSELF ANDMY PERSONAL AFFAIRS DRAWN INTO THE VORTEX OF THE GREAT WORLD AFFAIRS WHETHER IT WAS MY LOVE FOR ERNEST  OR THE CLEAR SIGHT HE HAD GIVEN ME OFTHE SOCIETY IN WHICH I LIVED  THAT MADE ME A REVOLUTIONIST  I KNOW NOT BUT A REVOLUTIONIST I BECAME  AND I WAS PLUNGED INTO A WHIRL OFHAPPENINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCONCEIVABLE THREE SHORT MONTHS BEFORE THE CRISIS IN MY OWN FORTUNES CAME SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH GREAT CRISES INSOCIETY  FIRST OF ALL  FATHER WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE UNIVERSITY  OH HE WAS NOT TECHNICALLY DISCHARGED  HIS RESIGNATION WAS DEMANDED  THATWAS ALL  THIS  IN ITSELF  DID NOT AMOUNT TO MUCH  FATHER  IN FACT  WASDELIGHTED  HE WAS ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED BECAUSE HIS DISCHARGE HAD BEENPRECIPITATED BY THE PUBLICATION OF HIS BOOK   ECONOMICS AND EDUCATION  IT CLINCHED HIS ARGUMENT  HE CONTENDED  WHAT BETTER EVIDENCE COULD BEADVANCED TO PROVE THAT EDUCATION WAS DOMINATED BY THE CAPITALIST CLASS BUT THIS PROOF NEVER GOT ANYWHERE  NOBODY KNEW HE HAD BEEN FORCED TORESIGN FROM THE UNIVERSITY  HE WAS SO EMINENT A SCIENTIST THAT SUCH ANANNOUNCEMENT  COUPLED WITH THE REASON FOR HIS ENFORCED RESIGNATION WOULD HAVE CREATED SOMEWHAT OF A FUROR ALL OVER THE WORLD  THENEWSPAPERS SHOWERED HIM WITH PRAISE AND HONOR  AND COMMENDED HIM FORHAVING GIVEN UP THE DRUDGERY OF THE LECTURE ROOM IN ORDER TO DEVOTE HISWHOLE TIME TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AT FIRST FATHER LAUGHED  THEN HE BECAME ANGRY  TONIC ANGRY  THEN CAMETHE SUPPRESSION OF HIS BOOK  THIS SUPPRESSION WAS PERFORMED SECRETLY SO SECRETLY THAT AT FIRST WE COULD NOT COMPREHEND  THE PUBLICATION OFTHE BOOK HAD IMMEDIATELY CAUSED A BIT OF EXCITEMENT IN THE COUNTRY FATHER HAD BEEN POLITELY ABUSED IN THE CAPITALIST PRESS  THE TONE OF THEABUSE BEING TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WAS A PITY SO GREAT A SCIENTIST SHOULDLEAVE HIS FIELD AND INVADE THE REALM OF SOCIOLOGY  ABOUT WHICH HE KNEWNOTHING AND WHEREIN HE HAD PROMPTLY BECOME LOST  THIS LASTED FOR AWEEK  WHILE FATHER CHUCKLED AND SAID THE BOOK HAD TOUCHED A SORE SPOT ONCAPITALISM  AND THEN  ABRUPTLY  THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE CRITICALMAGAZINES CEASED SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE BOOK AT ALL  ALSO  AND WITHEQUAL SUDDENNESS  THE BOOK DISAPPEARED FROM THE MARKET  NOT A COPY WASOBTAINABLE FROM ANY BOOKSELLER  FATHER WROTE TO THE PUBLISHERS AND WASINFORMED THAT THE PLATES HAD BEEN ACCIDENTALLY INJURED  ANUNSATISFACTORY CORRESPONDENCE FOLLOWED  DRIVEN FINALLY TO ANUNEQUIVOCAL STAND  THE PUBLISHERS STATED THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THEIRWAY TO PUTTING THE BOOK INTO TYPE AGAIN  BUT THAT THEY WERE WILLING TORELINQUISH THEIR RIGHTS IN IT  AND YOU WON T FIND ANOTHER PUBLISHING HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY TO TOUCHIT   ERNEST SAID   AND IF I WERE YOU  I D HUNT COVER RIGHT NOW  YOU VEMERELY GOT A FORETASTE OF THE IRON HEEL  BUT FATHER WAS NOTHING IF NOT A SCIENTIST  HE NEVER BELIEVED IN JUMPINGTO CONCLUSIONS  A LABORATORY EXPERIMENT WAS NO EXPERIMENT IF IT WERENOT CARRIED THROUGH IN ALL ITS DETAILS  SO HE PATIENTLY WENT THE ROUNDOF THE PUBLISHING HOUSES  THEY GAVE A MULTITUDE OF EXCUSES  BUT NOT ONEHOUSE WOULD CONSIDER THE BOOK WHEN FATHER BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE BOOK HAD ACTUALLY BEEN SUPPRESSED HE TRIED TO GET THE FACT INTO THE NEWSPAPERS  BUT HIS COMMUNICATIONSWERE IGNORED  AT A POLITICAL MEETING OF THE SOCIALISTS  WHERE MANYREPORTERS WERE PRESENT  FATHER SAW HIS CHANCE  HE AROSE AND RELATED THEHISTORY OF THE SUPPRESSION OF THE BOOK  HE LAUGHED NEXT DAY WHEN HEREAD THE NEWSPAPERS  AND THEN HE GREW ANGRY TO A DEGREE THAT ELIMINATEDALL TONIC QUALITIES  THE PAPERS MADE NO MENTION OF THE BOOK  BUT THEYMISREPORTED HIM BEAUTIFULLY  THEY TWISTED HIS WORDS AND PHRASES AWAYFROM THE CONTEXT  AND TURNED HIS SUBDUED AND CONTROLLED REMARKS INTO AHOWLING ANARCHISTIC SPEECH  IT WAS DONE ARTFULLY  ONE INSTANCE  INPARTICULAR  I REMEMBER  HE HAD USED THE PHRASE  SOCIAL REVOLUTION  THE REPORTER MERELY DROPPED OUT  SOCIAL   THIS WAS SENT OUT ALL OVERTHE COUNTRY IN AN ASSOCIATED PRESS DESPATCH  AND FROM ALL OVER THECOUNTRY AROSE A CRY OF ALARM  FATHER WAS BRANDED AS A NIHILIST AND ANANARCHIST  AND IN ONE CARTOON THAT WAS COPIED WIDELY HE WAS PORTRAYEDWAVING A RED FLAG AT THE HEAD OF A MOB OF LONG HAIRED  WILD EYED MEN WHOBORE IN THEIR HANDS TORCHES  KNIVES  AND DYNAMITE BOMBS HE WAS ASSAILED TERRIBLY IN THE PRESS  IN LONG AND ABUSIVE EDITORIALS FOR HIS ANARCHY  AND HINTS WERE MADE OF MENTAL BREAKDOWN ON HIS PART THIS BEHAVIOR  ON THE PART OF THE CAPITALIST PRESS  WAS NOTHING NEW ERNEST TOLD US  IT WAS THE CUSTOM  HE SAID  TO SEND REPORTERS TO ALLTHE SOCIALIST MEETINGS FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF MISREPORTING ANDDISTORTING WHAT WAS SAID  IN ORDER TO FRIGHTEN THE MIDDLE CLASS AWAYFROM ANY POSSIBLE AFFILIATION WITH THE PROLETARIAT  AND REPEATEDLYERNEST WARNED FATHER TO CEASE FIGHTING AND TO TAKE TO COVER THE SOCIALIST PRESS OF THE COUNTRY TOOK UP THE FIGHT  HOWEVER  ANDTHROUGHOUT THE READING PORTION OF THE WORKING CLASS IT WAS KNOWN THATTHE BOOK HAD BEEN SUPPRESSED  BUT THIS KNOWLEDGE STOPPED WITH THEWORKING CLASS  NEXT  THE  APPEAL TO REASON   A BIG SOCIALIST PUBLISHINGHOUSE  ARRANGED WITH FATHER TO BRING OUT THE BOOK  FATHER WAS JUBILANT BUT ERNEST WAS ALARMED  I TELL YOU WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF THE UNKNOWN   HE INSISTED   BIGTHINGS ARE HAPPENING SECRETLY ALL AROUND US  WE CAN FEEL THEM  WE DONOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE  BUT THEY ARE THERE  THE WHOLE FABRIC OF SOCIETYIS A TREMBLE WITH THEM  DON T ASK ME  I DON T KNOW MYSELF  BUT OUT OFTHIS FLUX OF SOCIETY SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO CRYSTALLIZE  IT ISCRYSTALLIZING NOW  THE SUPPRESSION OF THE BOOK IS A PRECIPITATION  HOWMANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED  WE HAVEN T THE LEAST IDEA  WE ARE INTHE DARK  WE HAVE NO WAY OF LEARNING  WATCH OUT NEXT FOR THESUPPRESSION OF THE SOCIALIST PRESS AND SOCIALIST PUBLISHING HOUSES  I MAFRAID IT S COMING  WE ARE GOING TO BE THROTTLED  ERNEST HAD HIS HAND ON THE PULSE OF EVENTS EVEN MORE CLOSELY THAN THEREST OF THE SOCIALISTS  AND WITHIN TWO DAYS THE FIRST BLOW WAS STRUCK THE APPEAL TO REASON WAS A WEEKLY  AND ITS REGULAR CIRCULATION AMONGSTTHE PROLETARIAT WAS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND  ALSO  IT VERYFREQUENTLY GOT OUT SPECIAL EDITIONS OF FROM TWO TO FIVE MILLIONS  THESEGREAT EDITIONS WERE PAID FOR AND DISTRIBUTED BY THE SMALL ARMY OFVOLUNTARY WORKERS WHO HAD MARSHALLED AROUND THE APPEAL  THE FIRST BLOWWAS AIMED AT THESE SPECIAL EDITIONS  AND IT WAS A CRUSHING ONE  BY ANARBITRARY RULING OF THE POST OFFICE  THESE EDITIONS WERE DECIDED TO BENOT THE REGULAR CIRCULATION OF THE PAPER  AND FOR THAT REASON WEREDENIED ADMISSION TO THE MAILS A WEEK LATER THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT RULED THAT THE PAPER WASSEDITIOUS  AND BARRED IT ENTIRELY FROM THE MAILS  THIS WAS A FEARFULBLOW TO THE SOCIALIST PROPAGANDA  THE APPEAL WAS DESPERATE  IT DEVISEDA PLAN OF REACHING ITS SUBSCRIBERS THROUGH THE EXPRESS COMPANIES  BUTTHEY DECLINED TO HANDLE IT  THIS WAS THE END OF THE APPEAL  BUT NOTQUITE  IT PREPARED TO GO ON WITH ITS BOOK PUBLISHING  TWENTY THOUSANDCOPIES OF FATHER S BOOK WERE IN THE BINDERY  AND THE PRESSES WERETURNING OFF MORE  AND THEN  WITHOUT WARNING  A MOB AROSE ONE NIGHT AND  UNDER A WAVING AMERICAN FLAG  SINGING PATRIOTIC SONGS  SET FIRE TOTHE GREAT PLANT OF THE APPEAL AND TOTALLY DESTROYED IT NOW GIRARD  KANSAS  WAS A QUIET  PEACEABLE TOWN  THERE HAD NEVER BEENANY LABOR TROUBLES THERE  THE APPEAL PAID UNION WAGES  AND  IN FACT WAS THE BACKBONE OF THE TOWN  GIVING EMPLOYMENT TO HUNDREDS OF MEN ANDWOMEN  IT WAS NOT THE CITIZENS OF GIRARD THAT COMPOSED THE MOB  THISMOB HAD RISEN UP OUT OF THE EARTH APPARENTLY  AND TO ALL INTENTS ANDPURPOSES  ITS WORK DONE  IT HAD GONE BACK INTO THE EARTH  ERNEST SAW INTHE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT  THE BLACK HUNDREDS  ARE BEING ORGANIZED IN THE UNITED STATES   HE SAID  THIS IS THE BEGINNING  THERE WILL BE MORE OF IT  THE IRON HEEL ISGETTING BOLD         THE BLACK HUNDREDS WERE REACTIONARY MOBS ORGANIZED BY THE     PERISHING AUTOCRACY IN THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION   THESE     REACTIONARY GROUPS ATTACKED THE REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS  AND     ALSO  AT NEEDED MOMENTS  RIOTED AND DESTROYED PROPERTY SO AS     TO AFFORD THE AUTOCRACY THE PRETEXT OF CALLING OUT THE     COSSACKS AND SO PERISHED FATHER S BOOK  WE WERE TO SEE MUCH OF THE BLACK HUNDREDSAS THE DAYS WENT BY  WEEK BY WEEK MORE OF THE SOCIALIST PAPERS WEREBARRED FROM THE MAILS  AND IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES THE BLACK HUNDREDSDESTROYED THE SOCIALIST PRESSES  OF COURSE  THE NEWSPAPERS OF THELAND LIVED UP TO THE REACTIONARY POLICY OF THE RULING CLASS  AND THEDESTROYED SOCIALIST PRESS WAS MISREPRESENTED AND VILIFIED  WHILETHE BLACK HUNDREDS WERE REPRESENTED AS TRUE PATRIOTS AND SAVIOURS OFSOCIETY  SO CONVINCING WAS ALL THIS MISREPRESENTATION THAT EVEN SINCEREMINISTERS IN THE PULPIT PRAISED THE BLACK HUNDREDS WHILE REGRETTING THENECESSITY OF VIOLENCE HISTORY WAS MAKING FAST  THE FALL ELECTIONS WERE SOON TO OCCUR  ANDERNEST WAS NOMINATED BY THE SOCIALIST PARTY TO RUN FOR CONGRESS  HISCHANCE FOR ELECTION WAS MOST FAVORABLE  THE STREET CAR STRIKE IN SANFRANCISCO HAD BEEN BROKEN  AND FOLLOWING UPON IT THE TEAMSTERS  STRIKEHAD BEEN BROKEN  THESE TWO DEFEATS HAD BEEN VERY DISASTROUS TO ORGANIZEDLABOR  THE WHOLE WATER FRONT FEDERATION  ALONG WITH ITS ALLIES IN THESTRUCTURAL TRADES  HAD BACKED UP THE TEAMSTERS  AND ALL HAD SMASHEDDOWN INGLORIOUSLY  IT HAD BEEN A BLOODY STRIKE  THE POLICE HAD BROKENCOUNTLESS HEADS WITH THEIR RIOT CLUBS  AND THE DEATH LIST HAD BEENAUGMENTED BY THE TURNING LOOSE OF A MACHINE GUN ON THE STRIKERS FROM THEBARNS OF THE MARSDEN SPECIAL DELIVERY COMPANY IN CONSEQUENCE  THE MEN WERE SULLEN AND VINDICTIVE  THEY WANTED BLOOD AND REVENGE  BEATEN ON THEIR CHOSEN FIELD  THEY WERE RIPE TO SEEKREVENGE BY MEANS OF POLITICAL ACTION  THEY STILL MAINTAINED THEIR LABORORGANIZATION  AND THIS GAVE THEM STRENGTH IN THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE THATWAS ON  ERNEST S CHANCE FOR ELECTION GREW STRONGER AND STRONGER  DAY BYDAY UNIONS AND MORE UNIONS VOTED THEIR SUPPORT TO THE SOCIALISTS  UNTILEVEN ERNEST LAUGHED WHEN THE UNDERTAKERS  ASSISTANTS AND THE CHICKENPICKERS FELL INTO LINE  LABOR BECAME MULISH  WHILE IT PACKED THESOCIALIST MEETINGS WITH MAD ENTHUSIASM  IT WAS IMPERVIOUS TO THE WILESOF THE OLD PARTY POLITICIANS  THE OLD PARTY ORATORS WERE USUALLY GREETEDWITH EMPTY HALLS  THOUGH OCCASIONALLY THEY ENCOUNTERED FULL HALLS WHERETHEY WERE SO ROUGHLY HANDLED THAT MORE THAN ONCE IT WAS NECESSARY TOCALL OUT THE POLICE RESERVES HISTORY WAS MAKING FAST  THE AIR WAS VIBRANT WITH THINGS HAPPENING ANDIMPENDING  THE COUNTRY WAS ON THE VERGE OF HARD TIMES   CAUSED BY ASERIES OF PROSPEROUS YEARS WHEREIN THE DIFFICULTY OF DISPOSING ABROADOF THE UNCONSUMED SURPLUS HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT  INDUSTRIESWERE WORKING SHORT TIME  MANY GREAT FACTORIES WERE STANDING IDLE AGAINSTTHE TIME WHEN THE SURPLUS SHOULD BE GONE  AND WAGES WERE BEING CUT RIGHTAND LEFT        UNDER THE CAPITALIST REGIME THESE PERIODS OF HARD TIMES     WERE AS INEVITABLE AS THEY WERE ABSURD   PROSPERITY ALWAYS     BROUGHT CALAMITY   THIS  OF COURSE  WAS DUE TO THE EXCESS OF     UNCONSUMED PROFITS THAT WAS PILED UP ALSO  THE GREAT MACHINIST STRIKE HAD BEEN BROKEN  TWO HUNDRED THOUSANDMACHINISTS  ALONG WITH THEIR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ALLIES IN THEMETALWORKING TRADES  HAD BEEN DEFEATED IN AS BLOODY A STRIKE AS HAD EVERMARRED THE UNITED STATES  PITCHED BATTLES HAD BEEN FOUGHT WITH THE SMALLARMIES OF ARMED STRIKE BREAKERS  PUT IN THE FIELD BY THE EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATIONS  THE BLACK HUNDREDS  APPEARING IN SCORES OF WIDE SCATTEREDPLACES  HAD DESTROYED PROPERTY  AND  IN CONSEQUENCE  A HUNDRED THOUSANDREGULAR SOLDIERS OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN CALLED OUT TO PUT AFRIGHTFUL END TO THE WHOLE AFFAIR  A NUMBER OF THE LABOR LEADERS HADBEEN EXECUTED  MANY OTHERS HAD BEEN SENTENCED TO PRISON  WHILE THOUSANDSOF THE RANK AND FILE OF THE STRIKERS HAD BEEN HERDED INTO BULL PENS  AND ABOMINABLY TREATED BY THE SOLDIERS        STRIKE BREAKERS  THESE WERE  IN PURPOSE AND PRACTICE AND     EVERYTHING EXCEPT NAME  THE PRIVATE SOLDIERS OF THE     CAPITALISTS  THEY WERE THOROUGHLY ORGANIZED AND WELL ARMED      AND THEY WERE HELD IN READINESS TO BE HURLED IN SPECIAL     TRAINS TO ANY PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE LABOR WENT ON STRIKE     OR WAS LOCKED OUT BY THE EMPLOYERS   ONLY THOSE CURIOUS     TIMES COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO THE AMAZING SPECTACLE OF ONE      FARLEY  A NOTORIOUS COMMANDER OF STRIKE BREAKERS  WHO  IN           SWEPT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IN SPECIAL TRAINS FROM     NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH AN ARMY OF TWENTY FIVE     HUNDRED MEN  FULLY ARMED AND EQUIPPED  TO BREAK A STRIKE OF     THE SAN FRANCISCO STREET CAR MEN   SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT     VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND   THE FACT THAT THIS ACT      AND THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR ACTS  WENT UNPUNISHED  GOES TO SHOW     HOW COMPLETELY THE JUDICIARY WAS THE CREATURE OF THE     PLUTOCRACY         BULL PEN  IN A MINERS  STRIKE IN IDAHO  IN THE LATTER     PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY  IT HAPPENED THAT MANY OF THE     STRIKERS WERE CONFINED IN A BULL PEN BY THE TROOPS   THE     PRACTICE AND THE NAME CONTINUED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE YEARS OF PROSPERITY WERE NOW TO BE PAID FOR  ALL MARKETS WEREGLUTTED  ALL MARKETS WERE FALLING  AND AMIDST THE GENERAL CRUMBLEOF PRICES THE PRICE OF LABOR CRUMBLED FASTEST OF ALL  THE LAND WASCONVULSED WITH INDUSTRIAL DISSENSIONS  LABOR WAS STRIKING HERE  THERE AND EVERYWHERE  AND WHERE IT WAS NOT STRIKING  IT WAS BEING TURNED OUTBY THE CAPITALISTS  THE PAPERS WERE FILLED WITH TALES OF VIOLENCE ANDBLOOD  AND THROUGH IT ALL THE BLACK HUNDREDS PLAYED THEIR PART  RIOT ARSON  AND WANTON DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY WAS THEIR FUNCTION  AND WELLTHEY PERFORMED IT  THE WHOLE REGULAR ARMY WAS IN THE FIELD  CALLED THEREBY THE ACTIONS OF THE BLACK HUNDREDS   ALL CITIES AND TOWNS WERE LIKEARMED CAMPS  AND LABORERS WERE SHOT DOWN LIKE DOGS  OUT OF THE VASTARMY OF THE UNEMPLOYED THE STRIKE BREAKERS WERE RECRUITED  AND WHENTHE STRIKE BREAKERS WERE WORSTED BY THE LABOR UNIONS  THE TROOPS ALWAYSAPPEARED AND CRUSHED THE UNIONS  THEN THERE WAS THE MILITIA  AS YET  ITWAS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE SECRET MILITIA LAW  ONLY THEREGULARLY ORGANIZED MILITIA WAS OUT  AND IT WAS OUT EVERYWHERE  ANDIN THIS TIME OF TERROR  THE REGULAR ARMY WAS INCREASED AN ADDITIONALHUNDRED THOUSAND BY THE GOVERNMENT        THE NAME ONLY  AND NOT THE IDEA  WAS IMPORTED FROM RUSSIA      THE BLACK HUNDREDS WERE A DEVELOPMENT OUT OF THE SECRET     AGENTS OF THE CAPITALISTS  AND THEIR USE AROSE IN THE LABOR     STRUGGLES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY   THERE IS NO DISCUSSION     OF THIS   NO LESS AN AUTHORITY OF THE TIMES THAN CARROLL D      WRIGHT  UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER OF LABOR  IS RESPONSIBLE     FOR THE STATEMENT   FROM HIS BOOK  ENTITLED  THE BATTLES OF     LABOR   IS QUOTED THE DECLARATION THAT  IN SOME OF THE GREAT     HISTORIC STRIKES THE EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES HAVE INSTIGATED     ACTS OF VIOLENCE   THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE DELIBERATELY     PROVOKED STRIKES IN ORDER TO GET RID OF SURPLUS STOCK  AND     THAT FREIGHT CARS HAVE BEEN BURNED BY EMPLOYERS  AGENTS     DURING RAILROAD STRIKES IN ORDER TO INCREASE DISORDER   IT     WAS OUT OF THESE SECRET AGENTS OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT THE     BLACK HUNDREDS AROSE  AND IT WAS THEY  IN TURN  THAT LATER     BECAME THAT TERRIBLE WEAPON OF THE OLIGARCHY  THE AGENTS      PROVOCATEURS NEVER HAD LABOR RECEIVED SUCH AN ALL AROUND BEATING  THE GREAT CAPTAINSOF INDUSTRY  THE OLIGARCHS  HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME THROWN THEIR FULLWEIGHT INTO THE

AT THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH IT HAD BEENDONE  HE SHOOK HIS HEAD OMINOUSLY AND LOOKED FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE TO THEFALL ELECTIONS  IT S NO USE   HE SAID   WE ARE BEATEN  THE IRON HEEL IS HERE  I HADHOPED

REVOLUTIONOF THE WORKING CLASS  OF COURSE WE WILL WIN  BUT I SHUDDER TO THINK OFIT  AND FROM THEN ON ERNEST PINNED HIS FAITH IN REVOLUTION  IN THIS HE WASIN ADVANCE OF HIS PARTY  HIS FELLOW SOCIALISTS COULD NOT AGREE WITH HIM THEY STILL INSISTED THAT VICTORY COULD BE GAINED THROUGH THE ELECTIONS IT WAS NOT THAT THEY WERE STUNNED  THEY WERE TOO COOL HEADED ANDCOURAGEOUS FOR THAT  THEY WERE MERELY INCREDULOUS  THAT WAS ALL  ERNESTCOULD NOT GET THEM SERIOUSLY TO FEAR THE COMING OF THE OLIGARCHY  THEYWERE STIRRED BY HIM  BUT THEY WERE TOO SURE OF THEIR OWN STRENGTH  THEREWAS NO ROOM IN THEIR THEORETICAL SOCIAL EVOLUTION FOR AN OLIGARCHY THEREFORE THE OLIGARCHY COULD NOT BE  WE LL SEND YOU TO CONGRESS AND IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT   THEY TOLD HIM ATONE OF OUR SECRET MEETINGS  AND WHEN THEY TAKE

BOAT TO SAN FRANCISCO  SO THAT THE WARNING HE GAVE FATHER WAS NOTPREMEDITATED  HAD THEY NOT MET ACCIDENTALLY  THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEENANY WARNING  NOT THAT THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT  HOWEVER FATHER CAME OF STOUT OLD MAYFLOWER  STOCK  AND THE BLOOD WAS IMPERATIVEIN HIM        ONE OF THE FIRST SHIPS THAT CARRIED COLONIES TO AMERICA      AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE NEW WORLD   DESCENDANTS OF THESE     ORIGINAL COLONISTS WERE FOR A WHILE INORDINATELY PROUD OF     THEIR GENEALOGY  BUT IN TIME THE BLOOD BECAME SO WIDELY     DIFFUSED THAT IT RAN IN THE VEINS PRACTICALLY OF ALL     AMERICANS  ERNEST WAS RIGHT   HE TOLD ME  AS SOON AS HE HAD RETURNED HOME   ERNESTIS A VERY REMARKABLE YOUNG MAN  AND I D RATHER SEE YOU HIS WIFE THAN THEWIFE OF ROCKEFELLER HIMSELF OR THE KING OF ENGLAND   WHAT S THE MATTER   I ASKED IN ALARM  THE OLIGARCHY IS ABOUT TO TREAD UPON OUR FACES  YOURS AND MINE  WICKSONAS MUCH AS TOLD ME SO  HE WAS VERY KIND  FOR AN OLIGARCH  HE OFFERED TOREINSTATE ME IN THE UNIVERSITY  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT  HE  WICKSON A SORDID MONEY GRABBER  HAS THE POWER TO DETERMINE WHETHER I SHALL ORSHALL NOT TEACH IN THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE  BUT HE OFFERED ME EVENBETTER THAN THAT  OFFERED TO MAKE ME PRESIDENT OF SOME GREAT COLLEGE OFPHYSICAL SCIENCES THAT IS BEING PLANNED  THE OLIGARCHY MUST GET RID OFITS SURPLUS SOMEHOW  YOU SEE   DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD THAT SOCIALIST LOVER OF YOUR DAUGHTER S  HE SAID   I TOLD HIM THAT WE WOULD WALK UPON THE FACES OF THE WORKINGCLASS  AND SO WE SHALL  AS FOR YOU  I HAVE FOR YOU A DEEP RESPECT ASA SCIENTIST  BUT IF YOU THROW YOUR FORTUNES IN WITH THE WORKINGCLASS  WELL  WATCH OUT FOR YOUR FACE  THAT IS ALL   AND THEN HE TURNEDAND LEFT ME   IT MEANS WE LL HAVE TO MARRY EARLIER THAN YOU PLANNED   WAS ERNEST SCOMMENT WHEN WE TOLD HIM I COULD NOT FOLLOW HIS REASONING  BUT I WAS SOON TO LEARN IT  IT WAS ATTHIS TIME THAT THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF THE SIERRA MILLS WAS PAID  OR RATHER  SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID  FOR FATHER DID NOT RECEIVE HIS  AFTERWAITING SEVERAL DAYS  FATHER WROTE TO THE SECRETARY  PROMPTLY CAMETHE REPLY THAT THERE WAS NO RECORD ON THE BOOKS OF FATHER S OWNING ANYSTOCK  AND A POLITE REQUEST

FATHER INSISTED ON LABORATORY METHODS  HE BROUGHT THE SIERRA MILLS INTOCOURT  BUT HE COULD NOT BRING THE BOOKS OF THE SIERRA MILLS INTO COURT HE DID NOT CONTROL THE COURTS  AND THE SIERRA MILLS DID  THAT EXPLAINEDIT ALL  HE WAS THOROUGHLY BEATEN BY THE LAW  AND THE BARE FACED ROBBERYHELD GOOD IT IS ALMOST LAUGHABLE NOW  WHEN I LOOK BACK ON IT  THE WAY FATHER WASBEATEN  HE MET WICKSON ACCIDENTALLY ON THE STREET IN SAN FRANCISCO AND HE TOLD WICKSON THAT HE WAS A DAMNED SCOUNDREL  AND THEN FATHER WASARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTED ASSAULT  FINED IN THE POLICE COURT  AND BOUNDOVER TO KEEP THE PEACE  IT WAS ALL SO RIDICULOUS THAT WHEN HE GOTHOME HE HAD TO LAUGH HIMSELF  BUT WHAT A FUROR WAS RAISED IN THELOCAL PAPERS  THERE WAS GRAVE TALK ABOUT THE BACILLUS OF VIOLENCE THATINFECTED ALL MEN WHO EMBRACED SOCIALISM  AND FATHER  WITH HIS LONG ANDPEACEFUL LIFE  WAS INSTANCED AS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF HOW THE BACILLUSOF VIOLENCE WORKED  ALSO  IT WAS ASSERTED BY MORE THAN ONE PAPER THATFATHER S MIND HAD WEAKENED UNDER THE STRAIN OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY  ANDCONFINEMENT IN A STATE ASYLUM FOR THE INSANE WAS SUGGESTED  NOR WAS THISMERELY TALK  IT WAS AN IMMINENT PERIL  BUT FATHER WAS WISE ENOUGH TO SEEIT  HE HAD THE BISHOP S EXPERIENCE TO LESSON FROM  AND HE LESSONEDWELL  HE KEPT QUIET NO MATTER WHAT INJUSTICE WAS PERPETRATED ON HIM  ANDREALLY  I THINK  SURPRISED HIS ENEMIES THERE WAS THE MATTER OF THE HOUSE  OUR HOME  A MORTGAGE WAS FORECLOSEDON IT  AND WE HAD TO GIVE UP POSSESSION  OF COURSE THERE WASN T ANYMORTGAGE  AND NEVER HAD BEEN ANY MORTGAGE  THE GROUND HAD BEEN BOUGHTOUTRIGHT  AND THE HOUSE HAD BEEN PAID FOR WHEN IT WAS BUILT  AND HOUSEAND LOT HAD ALWAYS BEEN FREE AND UNENCUMBERED  NEVERTHELESS THERE WASTHE MORTGAGE  PROPERLY AND LEGALLY DRAWN UP AND SIGNED  WITH A RECORDOF THE PAYMENTS OF INTEREST THROUGH A NUMBER OF YEARS  FATHER MADE NOOUTCRY  AS HE HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS MONEY  SO WAS HE NOW ROBBED OF HISHOME  AND HE HAD NO RECOURSE  THE MACHINERY OF SOCIETY WAS IN THE HANDSOF THOSE WHO WERE BENT ON BREAKING HIM  HE WAS A PHILOSOPHER AT HEART AND HE WAS NO LONGER EVEN ANGRY  I AM DOOMED TO BE BROKEN   HE SAID TO ME   BUT THAT IS NO REASON THAT ISHOULD NOT TRY TO BE SHATTERED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE  THESE OLD BONES OFMINE ARE FRAGILE  AND I VE LEARNED MY LESSON  GOD KNOWS I DON T WANT TOSPEND MY LAST DAYS IN AN INSANE ASYLUM  WHICH REMINDS ME OF BISHOP MOREHOUSE  WHOM I HAVE NEGLECTED FOR MANYPAGES  BUT FIRST LET ME TELL OF MY MARRIAGE  IN THE PLAY OF EVENTS  MYMARRIAGE SINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE  I KNOW  SO I SHALL BARELY MENTIONIT  NOW WE SHALL BECOME REAL PROLETARIANS   FATHER SAID  WHEN WE WEREDRIVEN FROM OUR HOME   I HAVE OFTEN ENVIED THAT YOUNG MAN OF YOURS FORHIS ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROLETARIAT  NOW I SHALL SEE AND LEARN FORMYSELF  FATHER MUST HAVE HAD STRONG IN HIM THE BLOOD OF ADVENTURE  HE LOOKEDUPON OUR CATASTROPHE IN THE LIGHT OF AN ADVENTURE  NO ANGER NORBITTERNESS POSSESSED HIM  HE WAS TOO PHILOSOPHIC AND SIMPLE TO BEVINDICTIVE  AND HE LIVED TOO MUCH IN THE WORLD OF MIND TO MISS THECREATURE COMFORTS WE WERE GIVING UP  SO IT WAS  WHEN WE MOVED TO SANFRANCISCO INTO FOUR WRETCHED ROOMS IN THE SLUM SOUTH OF MARKET STREET THAT HE EMBARKED UPON THE ADVENTURE WITH THE JOY AND ENTHUSIASM OFA CHILD  COMBINED WITH THE CLEAR SIGHT AND MENTAL GRASP OF ANEXTRAORDINARY INTELLECT  HE REALLY NEVER CRYSTALLIZED MENTALLY  HE HADNO FALSE SENSE OF VALUES  CONVENTIONAL OR HABITUAL VALUES MEANT NOTHINGTO HIM  THE ONLY VALUES HE RECOGNIZED WERE MATHEMATICAL AND SCIENTIFICFACTS  MY FATHER WAS A GREAT MAN  HE HAD THE MIND AND THE SOUL THAT ONLYGREAT MEN HAVE  IN WAYS HE WAS EVEN GREATER THAN ERNEST  THAN WHOM IHAVE KNOWN NONE GREATER EVEN I FOUND SOME RELIEF IN OUR CHANGE OF LIVING  IF NOTHING ELSE  IWAS ESCAPING FROM THE ORGANIZED OSTRACISM THAT HAD BEEN OUR INCREASINGPORTION IN THE UNIVERSITY TOWN EVER SINCE THE ENMITY OF THE NASCENTOLIGARCHY HAD BEEN INCURRED  AND THE CHANGE WAS TO ME LIKEWISEADVENTURE  AND THE GREATEST OF ALL  FOR IT WAS LOVE ADVENTURE  THECHANGE IN OUR FORTUNES HAD HASTENED MY MARRIAGE  AND IT WAS AS AWIFE THAT I CAME TO LIVE IN THE FOUR ROOMS ON PELL STREET  IN THE SANFRANCISCO SLUM AND THIS OUT OF ALL REMAINS  I MADE ERNEST HAPPY  I CAME INTO HIS STORMYLIFE  NOT AS A NEW PERTURBING FORCE  BUT AS ONE THAT MADE TOWARD PEACEAND REPOSE  I GAVE HIM REST  IT WAS THE GUERDON OF MY LOVE FOR HIM IT WAS THE ONE INFALLIBLE TOKEN THAT I HAD NOT FAILED  TO BRINGFORGETFULNESS  OR THE LIGHT OF GLADNESS  INTO THOSE POOR TIRED EYES OFHIS  WHAT GREATER JOY COULD HAVE BLESSED ME THAN THAT THOSE DEAR TIRED EYES  HE TOILED AS FEW MEN EVER TOILED  AND ALL HISLIFETIME HE TOILED FOR OTHERS  THAT WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS MANHOOD  HEWAS A HUMANIST AND A LOVER  AND HE  WITH HIS INCARNATE SPIRIT OF BATTLE HIS GLADIATOR BODY AND HIS EAGLE SPIRIT  HE WAS AS GENTLE AND TENDER TOME AS A POET  HE WAS A POET  A SINGER IN DEEDS  AND ALL HIS LIFE HE SANGTHE SONG OF MAN  AND HE DID IT OUT OF SHEER LOVE OF MAN  AND FOR MAN HEGAVE HIS LIFE AND WAS CRUCIFIED AND ALL THIS HE DID WITH NO HOPE OF FUTURE REWARD  IN HIS CONCEPTION OFTHINGS THERE WAS NO FUTURE LIFE  HE  WHO FAIRLY BURNT WITH IMMORTALITY DENIED HIMSELF IMMORTALITY  SUCH WAS THE PARADOX OF HIM  HE  SO WARMIN SPIRIT  WAS DOMINATED BY THAT COLD AND FORBIDDING PHILOSOPHY MATERIALISTIC MONISM  I USED TO REFUTE HIM BY TELLING HIM THAT IMEASURED HIS IMMORTALITY BY THE WINGS OF HIS SOUL  AND THAT I SHOULDHAVE TO LIVE ENDLESS AEONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE FULL MEASUREMENT WHEREAT HE WOULD LAUGH  AND HIS ARMS WOULD LEAP OUT TO ME  AND HE WOULDCALL ME HIS SWEET METAPHYSICIAN  AND THE TIREDNESS WOULD PASS OUT OF HISEYES  AND INTO THEM WOULD FLOOD THE HAPPY LOVE LIGHT THAT WAS IN ITSELFA NEW AND SUFFICIENT ADVERTISEMENT OF HIS IMMORTALITY ALSO  HE USED TO CALL ME HIS DUALIST  AND HE WOULD EXPLAIN HOW KANT  BYMEANS OF PURE REASON  HAD ABOLISHED REASON  IN ORDER TO WORSHIP GOD  ANDHE DREW THE PARALLEL AND INCLUDED ME GUILTY OF A SIMILAR ACT  AND WHEN IPLEADED GUILTY  BUT DEFENDED THE ACT AS HIGHLY RATIONAL  HE BUT PRESSEDME CLOSER AND LAUGHED AS ONLY ONE OF GOD S OWN LOVERS COULD LAUGH  IWAS WONT TO DENY THAT HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT COULD EXPLAIN HIS OWNORIGINALITY AND GENIUS  ANY MORE THAN COULD THE COLD GROPING FINGER OFSCIENCE CATCH AND ANALYZE AND CLASSIFY THAT ELUSIVE ESSENCE THAT LURKEDIN THE CONSTITUTION OF LIFE ITSELF I HELD THAT SPACE WAS AN APPARITION OF GOD  AND THAT SOUL WAS APROJECTION OF THE CHARACTER OF GOD  AND WHEN HE CALLED ME HIS SWEETMETAPHYSICIAN  I CALLED HIM MY IMMORTAL MATERIALIST  AND SO WE LOVED ANDWERE HAPPY  AND I FORGAVE HIM HIS MATERIALISM BECAUSE OF HIS TREMENDOUSWORK IN THE WORLD  PERFORMED WITHOUT THOUGHT OF SOUL GAIN THEREBY  ANDBECAUSE OF HIS SO EXCEEDING MODESTY OF SPIRIT THAT PREVENTED HIM FROMHAVING PRIDE AND REGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIMSELF AND HIS SOUL BUT HE HAD PRIDE  HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN AN EAGLE AND NOT HAVE PRIDE HIS CONTENTION WAS THAT IT WAS FINER FOR A FINITE MORTAL SPECK OF LIFETO FEEL GODLIKE  THAN FOR A GOD TO FEEL GODLIKE  AND SO IT WAS THAT HEEXALTED WHAT HE DEEMED HIS MORTALITY  HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENTFROM A CERTAIN POEM  HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE WHOLE POEM  AND HE HAD TRIEDVAINLY TO LEARN ITS AUTHORSHIP  I HERE GIVE THE FRAGMENT  NOT ALONEBECAUSE HE LOVED IT  BUT BECAUSE IT EPITOMIZED THE PARADOX THAT HE WASIN THE SPIRIT OF HIM  AND HIS CONCEPTION OF HIS SPIRIT  FOR HOW CAN AMAN  WITH THRILLING  AND BURNING  AND EXALTATION  RECITE THE FOLLOWINGAND STILL BE MERE MORTAL EARTH  A BIT OF FUGITIVE FORCE  AN EVANESCENTFORM  HERE IT IS       JOY UPON JOY AND GAIN UPON GAIN     ARE THE DESTINED RIGHTS OF MY BIRTH      AND I SHOUT THE PRAISE OF MY ENDLESS DAYS     TO THE ECHOING EDGE OF THE EARTH      THOUGH I SUFFER ALL DEATHS THAT A MAN CAN DIE     TO THE UTTERMOST END OF TIME      I HAVE DEEP DRAINED THIS  MY CUP OF BLISS      IN EVERY AGE AND CLIME        THE FROTH OF PRIDE  THE TANG OF POWER      THE SWEET OF WOMANHOOD      I DRAIN THE LEES UPON MY KNEES      FOR OH  THE DRAUGHT IS GOOD      I DRINK TO LIFE  I DRINK TO DEATH      AND SMACK MY LIPS WITH SONG      FOR WHEN I DIE  ANOTHER  I  SHALL PASS THE CUP ALONG       THE MAN YOU DROVE FROM EDEN S GROVE              WAS I  MY LORD  WAS I      AND I SHALL BE THERE WHEN THE EARTH AND THE AIR              ARE RENT FROM SEA TO SKY      FOR IT IS MY WORLD  MY GORGEOUS WORLD               THE WORLD OF MY DEAREST WOES      FROM THE FIRST FAINT CRY OF THE NEWBORN              TO THE RACK OF THE WOMAN S THROES       PACKED WITH THE PULSE OF AN UNBORN RACE      TORN WITH A WORLD S DESIRE      THE SURGING FLOOD OF MY WILD YOUNG BLOOD     WOULD QUENCH THE JUDGMENT FIRE      I AM MAN  MAN  MAN  FROM THE TINGLING FLESH     TO THE DUST OF MY EARTHLY GOAL      FROM THE NESTLING GLOOM OF THE PREGNANT WOMB     TO THE SHEEN OF MY NAKED SOUL      BONE OF MY BONE AND FLESH OF MY FLESH     THE WHOLE WORLD LEAPS TO MY WILL      AND THE UNSLAKED THIRST OF AN EDEN CURSED     SHALL HARROW THE EARTH FOR ITS FILL      ALMIGHTY GOD  WHEN I DRAIN LIFE S GLASS     OF ALL ITS RAINBOW GLEAMS      THE HAPLESS PLIGHT OF ETERNAL NIGHT     SHALL BE NONE TOO LONG FOR MY DREAMS       THE MAN YOU DROVE FROM EDEN S GROVE              WAS I  MY LORD  WAS I      AND I SHALL BE THERE WHEN THE EARTH AND THE AIR              ARE RENT FROM SEA TO SKY      FOR IT IS MY WORLD  MY GORGEOUS WORLD               THE WORLD OF MY DEAR DELIGHT      FROM THE BRIGHTEST GLEAM OF THE ARCTIC STREAM              TO THE DUSK OF MY OWN LOVE NIGHT  ERNEST ALWAYS OVERWORKED  HIS WONDERFUL CONSTITUTION KEPT HIM UP  BUTEVEN THAT CONSTITUTION COULD NOT KEEP THE TIRED LOOK OUT OF HIS EYES HIS DEAR  TIRED EYES  HE NEVER SLEPT MORE THAN FOUR AND ONE HALF HOURSA NIGHT  YET HE NEVER FOUND TIME TO DO ALL THE WORK HE WANTED TO DO HE NEVER CEASED FROM HIS ACTIVITIES AS A PROPAGANDIST  AND WAS ALWAYSSCHEDULED LONG IN ADVANCE FOR LECTURES TO WORKINGMEN S ORGANIZATIONS THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN  HE DID A MAN S FULL WORK IN THAT ALONE WITH THE SUPPRESSION OF THE SOCIALIST PUBLISHING HOUSES  HIS MEAGREROYALTIES CEASED  AND HE WAS HARD PUT TO MAKE A LIVING  FOR HE HAD TOMAKE A LIVING IN ADDITION TO ALL HIS OTHER LABOR  HE DID A GREAT DEALOF TRANSLATING FOR THE MAGAZINES ON SCIENTIFIC AND PHILOSOPHIC SUBJECTS AND  COMING HOME LATE AT NIGHT  WORN OUT FROM THE STRAIN OF THECAMPAIGN  HE WOULD PLUNGE INTO HIS TRANSLATING AND TOIL ON WELL INTO THEMORNING HOURS  AND IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING  THERE WAS HIS STUDYING TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH HE KEPT UP HIS STUDIES  AND HE STUDIEDPRODIGIOUSLY AND YET HE FOUND TIME IN WHICH TO LOVE ME AND MAKE ME HAPPY  BUT THISWAS ACCOMPLISHED ONLY THROUGH MY MERGING MY LIFE COMPLETELY INTO HIS  ILEARNED SHORTHAND AND TYPEWRITING  AND BECAME HIS SECRETARY  HE INSISTEDTHAT I SUCCEEDED IN CUTTING HIS WORK IN HALF  AND SO IT WAS THAT ISCHOOLED MYSELF TO UNDERSTAND HIS WORK  OUR INTERESTS BECAME MUTUAL  ANDWE WORKED TOGETHER AND PLAYED TOGETHER AND THEN THERE WERE OUR SWEET STOLEN MOMENTS IN THE MIDST OF OURWORK  JUST A WORD  OR CARESS  OR FLASH OF LOVE LIGHT  AND OUR MOMENTSWERE SWEETER FOR BEING STOLEN  FOR WE LIVED ON THE HEIGHTS  WHERE THEAIR WAS KEEN AND SPARKLING  WHERE THE TOIL WAS FOR HUMANITY  AND WHERESORDIDNESS AND SELFISHNESS NEVER ENTERED  WE LOVED LOVE  AND OUR LOVEWAS NEVER SMIRCHED BY ANYTHING LESS THAN THE BEST  AND THIS OUT OF ALLREMAINS  I DID NOT FAIL  I GAVE HIM REST  HE WHO WORKED SO HARD FOROTHERS  MY DEAR  TIRED EYED MORTALIST CHAPTER XIITHE BISHOPIT WAS AFTER MY MARRIAGE THAT I CHANCED UPON BISHOP MOREHOUSE  BUT IMUST GIVE THE EVENTS IN THEIR PROPER SEQUENCE  AFTER HIS OUTBREAK AT THEI  P  H  CONVENTION  THE BISHOP  BEING A GENTLE SOUL  HAD YIELDED TOTHE FRIENDLY PRESSURE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON HIM  AND HAD GONE AWAY ON AVACATION  BUT HE RETURNED MORE FIXED THAN EVER IN HIS DETERMINATIONTO PREACH THE MESSAGE OF THE CHURCH  TO THE CONSTERNATION OF HISCONGREGATION  HIS FIRST SERMON WAS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE ADDRESS HEHAD GIVEN BEFORE THE CONVENTION  AGAIN HE SAID  AND AT LENGTH AND WITHDISTRESSING DETAIL  THAT THE CHURCH HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THE MASTER STEACHING  AND THAT MAMMON HAD BEEN INSTATED IN THE PLACE OF CHRIST AND THE RESULT WAS  WILLY NILLY  THAT HE WAS LED AWAY TO A PRIVATESANITARIUM FOR MENTAL DISEASE  WHILE IN THE NEWSPAPERS APPEAREDPATHETIC ACCOUNTS OF HIS MENTAL BREAKDOWN AND OF THE SAINTLINESS OFHIS CHARACTER  HE WAS HELD A PRISONER IN THE SANITARIUM  I CALLEDREPEATEDLY  BUT WAS DENIED ACCESS TO HIM  AND I WAS TERRIBLY IMPRESSEDBY THE TRAGEDY OF A SANE  NORMAL  SAINTLY MAN BEING CRUSHED BY THEBRUTAL WILL OF SOCIETY  FOR THE BISHOP WAS SANE  AND PURE  AND NOBLE  ASERNEST SAID  ALL THAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM WAS THAT HE HAD INCORRECTNOTIONS OF BIOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY  AND BECAUSE OF HIS INCORRECT NOTIONSHE HAD NOT GONE ABOUT IT IN THE RIGHT WAY TO RECTIFY MATTERS WHAT TERRIFIED ME WAS THE BISHOP S HELPLESSNESS  IF HE PERSISTED IN THETRUTH AS HE SAW IT  HE WAS DOOMED TO AN INSANE WARD  AND HE COULD DONOTHING  HIS MONEY  HIS POSITION  HIS CULTURE  COULD NOT SAVE HIM  HISVIEWS WERE PERILOUS TO SOCIETY  AND SOCIETY COULD NOT CONCEIVE THAT SUCHPERILOUS VIEWS COULD BE THE PRODUCT OF A SANE MIND  OR  AT LEAST  ITSEEMS TO ME THAT SUCH WAS SOCIETY S ATTITUDE BUT THE BISHOP  IN SPITE OF THE GENTLENESS AND PURITY OF HIS SPIRIT  WASPOSSESSED OF GUILE  HE APPREHENDED CLEARLY HIS DANGER  HE SAW HIMSELFCAUGHT IN THE WEB  AND HE TRIED TO ESCAPE FROM IT  DENIED HELP FROM HISFRIENDS  SUCH AS FATHER AND ERNEST AND I COULD HAVE GIVEN  HE WASLEFT TO BATTLE FOR HIMSELF ALONE  AND IN THE ENFORCED SOLITUDE OF THESANITARIUM HE RECOVERED  HE BECAME AGAIN SANE  HIS EYES CEASED TO SEEVISIONS  HIS BRAIN WAS PURGED OF THE FANCY THAT IT WAS THE DUTY OFSOCIETY TO FEED THE MASTER S LAMBS AS I SAY  HE BECAME WELL  QUITE WELL  AND THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE CHURCHPEOPLE HAILED HIS RETURN WITH JOY  I WENT ONCE TO HIS CHURCH  THE SERMONWAS OF THE SAME ORDER AS THE ONES HE HAD PREACHED LONG BEFORE HIS EYESHAD SEEN VISIONS  I WAS DISAPPOINTED  SHOCKED  HAD SOCIETY THEN BEATENHIM INTO SUBMISSION  WAS HE A COWARD  HAD HE BEEN BULLDOZED INTORECANTING  OR HAD THE STRAIN BEEN TOO GREAT FOR HIM  AND HAD HE MEEKLYSURRENDERED TO THE JUGGERNAUT OF THE ESTABLISHED I CALLED UPON HIM IN HIS BEAUTIFUL HOME  HE WAS WOEFULLY CHANGED  HE WASTHINNER  AND THERE WERE LINES ON HIS FACE WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING  HE PLUCKED NERVOUSLY AT HISSLEEVE AS WE TALKED  AND HIS EYES WERE RESTLESS  FLUTTERING HERE  THERE AND EVERYWHERE  AND REFUSING TO MEET MINE  HIS MIND SEEMED PREOCCUPIED AND THERE WERE STRANGE PAUSES IN HIS CONVERSATION  ABRUPT CHANGES OFTOPIC  AND AN INCONSECUTIVENESS THAT WAS BEWILDERING  COULD THIS  THEN BE THE FIRM POISED  CHRIST LIKE MAN I HAD KNOWN  WITH PURE  LIMPID EYESAND A GAZE STEADY AND UNFALTERING AS HIS SOUL  HE HAD BEEN MAN HANDLED HE HAD BEEN COWED INTO SUBJECTION  HIS SPIRIT WAS TOO GENTLE  IT HAD NOTBEEN MIGHTY ENOUGH TO FACE THE ORGANIZED WOLF PACK OF SOCIETY I FELT SAD  UNUTTERABLY SAD  HE TALKED AMBIGUOUSLY  AND WAS SOAPPREHENSIVE OF WHAT I MIGHT SAY THAT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO CATECHISEHIM  HE SPOKE IN A FAR AWAY MANNER OF HIS ILLNESS  AND WE TALKEDDISJOINTEDLY ABOUT THE CHURCH  THE ALTERATIONS IN THE ORGAN  AND ABOUTPETTY CHARITIES  AND HE SAW ME DEPART WITH SUCH EVIDENT RELIEF THAT ISHOULD HAVE LAUGHED HAD NOT MY HEART BEEN SO FULL OF TEARS THE POOR LITTLE HERO  IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN  HE WAS BATTLING LIKE A GIANT AND I DID NOT GUESS IT  ALONE  ALL ALONE  IN THE MIDST OF MILLIONS OFHIS FELLOW MEN  HE WAS FIGHTING HIS FIGHT  TORN BY HIS HORROR OF THEASYLUM AND HIS FIDELITY TO TRUTH AND THE RIGHT  HE CLUNG STEADFASTLY TOTRUTH AND THE RIGHT  BUT SO ALONE WAS HE THAT HE DID NOT DARE TO TRUSTEVEN ME  HE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON WELL  TOO WELL BUT I WAS SOON TO KNOW  ONE DAY THE BISHOP DISAPPEARED  HE HAD TOLDNOBODY THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY  AND AS THE DAYS WENT BY AND HE DID NOTREAPPEAR  THERE WAS MUCH GOSSIP TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD COMMITTEDSUICIDE WHILE TEMPORARILY DERANGED  BUT THIS IDEA WAS DISPELLED WHEN ITWAS LEARNED THAT HE HAD SOLD ALL HIS POSSESSIONS   HIS CITY MANSION  HISCOUNTRY HOUSE AT MENLO PARK  HIS PAINTINGS  AND COLLECTIONS  AND EVENHIS CHERISHED LIBRARY  IT WAS PATENT THAT HE HAD MADE A CLEAN AND SECRETSWEEP OF EVERYTHING BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED THIS HAPPENED DURING THE TIME WHEN CALAMITY HAD OVERTAKEN US IN OUR OWNAFFAIRS  AND IT WAS NOT TILL WE WERE WELL SETTLED IN OUR NEW HOME THATWE HAD OPPORTUNITY REALLY TO WONDER AND SPECULATE ABOUT THE BISHOP SDOINGS  AND THEN  EVERYTHING WAS SUDDENLY MADE CLEAR  EARLY ONE EVENING WHILE IT WAS YET TWILIGHT  I HAD RUN ACROSS THE STREET AND INTO THEBUTCHER SHOP TO GET SOME CHOPS FOR ERNEST S SUPPER  WE CALLED THE LASTMEAL OF THE DAY  SUPPER  IN OUR NEW ENVIRONMENT JUST AT THE MOMENT I CAME OUT OF THE BUTCHER SHOP  A MAN EMERGED FROMTHE CORNER GROCERY THAT STOOD ALONGSIDE  A QUEER SENSE FAMILIARITY MADEME LOOK AGAIN  BUT THE MAN HAD TURNED AND WAS WALKING RAPIDLY AWAY THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE SLOPE OF THE SHOULDERS AND THE FRINGEOF SILVER HAIR BETWEEN COAT COLLAR AND SLOUCH HAT THAT AROUSED VAGUEMEMORIES  INSTEAD OF CROSSING THE STREET  I HURRIED AFTER THE MAN  IQUICKENED MY PACE  TRYING NOT TO THINK THE THOUGHTS THAT FORMED UNBIDDENIN MY BRAIN  NO  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE  IT COULD NOT BE  NOT IN THOSE FADEDOVERALLS  TOO LONG IN THE LEGS AND FRAYED AT THE BOTTOMS I PAUSED  LAUGHED AT MYSELF  AND ALMOST ABANDONED THE CHASE  BUT THEHAUNTING FAMILIARITY OF THOSE SHOULDERS AND THAT SILVER HAIR  AGAINI HURRIED ON  AS I PASSED HIM  I SHOT A KEEN LOOK AT HIS FACE  THEN IWHIRLED AROUND ABRUPTLY AND CONFRONTED  THE BISHOP HE HALTED WITH EQUAL ABRUPTNESS  AND GASPED  A LARGE PAPER BAG IN HISRIGHT HAND FELL TO THE SIDEWALK  IT BURST  AND ABOUT HIS FEET AND MINEBOUNCED AND ROLLED A FLOOD OF POTATOES  HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SURPRISEAND ALARM  THEN HE SEEMED TO WILT AWAY  THE SHOULDERS DROOPED WITHDEJECTION  AND HE UTTERED A DEEP SIGH I HELD OUT MY HAND  HE SHOOK IT  BUT HIS HAND FELT CLAMMY  HE CLEAREDHIS THROAT IN EMBARRASSMENT  AND I COULD SEE THE SWEAT STARTING OUT ONHIS FOREHEAD  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS BADLY FRIGHTENED  THE POTATOES   HE MURMURED FAINTLY   THEY ARE PRECIOUS  BETWEEN US WE PICKED THEM UP AND REPLACED THEM IN THE BROKEN BAG  WHICHHE NOW HELD CAREFULLY IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM  I TRIED TO TELL HIM MYGLADNESS AT MEETING HIM AND THAT HE MUST COME RIGHT HOME WITH ME  FATHER WILL BE REJOICED TO SEE YOU   I SAID   WE LIVE ONLY A STONE STHROW AWAY  I CAN T   HE SAID   I MUST BE GOING  GOOD BY  HE LOOKED APPREHENSIVELY ABOUT HIM  AS THOUGH DREADING DISCOVERY  ANDMADE AN ATTEMPT TO WALK ON  TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE  AND I SHALL CALL LATER   HE SAID  WHEN HE SAWTHAT I WALKED BESIDE HIM AND THAT IT WAS MY INTENTION TO STICK TO HIMNOW THAT HE WAS FOUND  NO   I ANSWERED FIRMLY   YOU MUST COME NOW  HE LOOKED AT THE POTATOES SPILLING ON HIS ARM  AND AT THE SMALL PARCELSON HIS OTHER ARM  REALLY  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE   HE SAID   FORGIVE ME FOR MY RUDENESS  IF YOUONLY KNEW  HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE GOING TO BREAK DOWN  BUT THE NEXT MOMENT HE HADHIMSELF IN CONTROL  BESIDES  THIS FOOD   HE WENT ON   IT IS A SAD CASE  IT IS TERRIBLE  SHEIS AN OLD WOMAN  I MUST TAKE IT TO HER AT ONCE  SHE IS SUFFERING FROMWANT OF IT  I MUST GO AT ONCE  YOU UNDERSTAND  THEN I WILL RETURN  IPROMISE YOU   LET ME GO WITH YOU   I VOLUNTEERED   IS IT FAR  HE SIGHED AGAIN  AND SURRENDERED  ONLY TWO BLOCKS   HE SAID   LET US HASTEN  UNDER THE BISHOP S GUIDANCE I LEARNED SOMETHING OF MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD I HAD NOT DREAMED SUCH WRETCHEDNESS AND MISERY EXISTED IN IT  OF COURSE THIS WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT CONCERN MYSELF WITH CHARITY  I HAD BECOMECONVINCED THAT ERNEST WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SNEERED AT CHARITY AS APOULTICING OF AN ULCER  REMOVE THE ULCER  WAS HIS REMEDY  GIVE TO THEWORKER HIS PRODUCT  PENSION AS SOLDIERS THOSE WHO GROW HONORABLY OLD INTHEIR TOIL  AND THERE WILL BE NO NEED FOR CHARITY  CONVINCED OF THIS I TOILED WITH HIM AT THE REVOLUTION  AND DID NOT EXHAUST MY ENERGY INALLEVIATING THE SOCIAL ILLS THAT CONTINUOUSLY AROSE FROM THE INJUSTICEOF THE SYSTEM I FOLLOWED THE BISHOP INTO A SMALL ROOM  TEN BY TWELVE  IN A REARTENEMENT  AND THERE WE FOUND A LITTLE OLD GERMAN WOMAN  SIXTY FOUR YEARSOLD  THE BISHOP SAID  SHE WAS SURPRISED AT SEEING ME  BUT SHE

THE DOOR  WHATA SPECTACLE HE WAS  ON HIS BACK HE CARRIED HALF A SACK OF COAL  WITHKINDLING ON TOP  SOME OF THE COAL DUST HAD COATED HIS FACE  AND THESWEAT FROM HIS EXERTIONS WAS RUNNING IN STREAKS  HE DROPPED HIS BURDENIN THE CORNER BY THE STOVE AND WIPED HIS FACE ON A COARSE BANDANAHANDKERCHIEF  I COULD SCARCELY ACCEPT THE VERDICT OF MY SENSES  THEBISHOP  BLACK AS A COAL HEAVER  IN A WORKINGMAN S CHEAP COTTON SHIRT ONE BUTTON WAS MISSING FROM THE THROAT   AND IN OVERALLS  THAT WAS THEMOST INCONGRUOUS OF ALL  THE OVERALLS  FRAYED AT THE BOTTOMS  DRAGGEDDOWN AT THE HEELS  AND HELD UP BY A NARROW LEATHER BELT AROUND THE HIPSSUCH AS LABORERS WEAR THOUGH THE BISHOP WAS WARM  THE POOR SWOLLEN HANDS OF THE OLD WOMAN WEREALREADY CRAMPING WITH THE COLD  AND BEFORE WE LEFT HER  THE BISHOP HADBUILT THE FIRE  WHILE I HAD PEELED THE POTATOES AND PUT THEM ON TO BOIL I WAS TO LEARN  AS TIME WENT BY  THAT THERE WERE MANY CASES SIMILARTO HERS  AND MANY WORSE  HIDDEN AWAY IN THE MONSTROUS DEPTHS OF THETENEMENTS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WE GOT BACK TO FIND ERNEST ALARMED BY MY ABSENCE  AFTER THE FIRSTSURPRISE OF GREETING WAS OVER  THE BISHOP LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR STRETCHED OUT HIS OVERALL COVERED

LONELINESS  HE TOLD US MUCH  THOUGH HE TOLDUS MORE OF THE JOY HE HAD EXPERIENCED IN DOING THE MASTER S BIDDING  FOR TRULY NOW   HE SAID   I AM FEEDING HIS LAMBS  AND I HAVE LEARNEDA GREAT LESSON  THE SOUL CANNOT BE MINISTERED TO TILL THE STOMACH ISAPPEASED  HIS LAMBS MUST BE FED BREAD AND BUTTER AND POTATOES ANDMEAT  AFTER THAT  AND ONLY AFTER THAT  ARE THEIR SPIRITS READY FOR MOREREFINED NOURISHMENT  HE ATE HEARTILY OF THE SUPPER I COOKED  NEVER HAD HE HAD SUCH ANAPPETITE AT OUR TABLE IN THE OLD DAYS  WE SPOKE OF IT  AND HE SAID THATHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO HEALTHY IN HIS LIFE  I WALK

 AND I AM VERYHAPPY  INDEED  MOST HAPPY  AT LAST I AM A CONSECRATED SPIRIT  AND YET THERE WAS IN HIS FACE A PERMANENT PAIN  THE PAIN OF THE WORLDTHAT HE WAS NOW TAKING TO HIMSELF  HE WAS SEEING LIFE IN THE RAW  AND ITWAS A DIFFERENT LIFE FROM WHAT HE HAD KNOWN WITHIN THE PRINTED BOOKS OFHIS LIBRARY  AND YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THIS  YOUNG MAN   HE SAID DIRECTLY TOERNEST ERNEST WAS EMBARRASSED AND AWKWARD  I  I WARNED YOU   HE FALTERED  NO  YOU MISUNDERSTAND   THE BISHOP ANSWERED   I SPEAK NOT IN REPROACH BUT IN GRATITUDE  I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR SHOWING ME MY PATH  YOU LED MEFROM THEORIES

UNTIL I REALIZEDHOW MUCH POTATOES AND BREAD AND BUTTER AND MEAT IT COULD BUY  AND THENI REALIZED SOMETHING MORE  I REALIZED THAT ALL THOSE POTATOES AND THATBREAD AND BUTTER AND MEAT WERE MINE  AND THAT I HAD NOT WORKED TO MAKETHEM  THEN IT WAS CLEAR TO ME  SOME ONE ELSE HAD WORKED AND MADE THEMAND BEEN ROBBED OF THEM  AND WHEN I CAME DOWN AMONGST THE POOR I FOUNDTHOSE WHO HAD BEEN ROBBED AND WHO WERE HUNGRY AND WRETCHED BECAUSE THEYHAD BEEN ROBBED  WE DREW HIM BACK TO HIS NARRATIVE  THE MONEY  I HAVE IT DEPOSITED IN MANY DIFFERENT BANKS UNDER DIFFERENTNAMES  IT CAN NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME  BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER BEFOUND  AND IT IS SO GOOD  THAT MONEY  IT BUYS SO MUCH FOOD  I NEVER KNEWBEFORE WHAT MONEY WAS GOOD FOR   I WISH WE COULD GET SOME OF IT FOR THE PROPAGANDA   ERNEST SAIDWISTFULLY   IT WOULD DO IMMENSE GOOD   DO YOU THINK SO   THE BISHOP SAID   I DO NOT HAVE MUCH FAITH INPOLITICS  IN FACT  I AM AFRAID I DO NOT UNDERSTAND POLITICS  ERNEST WAS DELICATE IN SUCH MATTERS  HE DID NOT REPEAT HIS SUGGESTION THOUGH HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL THE SORE STRAITS THE SOCIALIST PARTY WAS INTHROUGH LACK OF MONEY  I SLEEP IN CHEAP LODGING HOUSES   THE BISHOP WENT ON   BUT I AM AFRAID AND NEVER STAY LONG IN ONE PLACE  ALSO  I RENT TWO ROOMS IN WORKINGMEN SHOUSES IN DIFFERENT QUARTERS OF THE CITY  IT IS A GREAT EXTRAVAGANCE I KNOW  BUT IT IS NECESSARY  I MAKE UP FOR IT IN PART BY DOING MY OWNCOOKING  THOUGH SOMETIMES I GET SOMETHING TO EAT IN CHEAP COFFEE HOUSES AND I HAVE MADE A DISCOVERY  TAMALES  ARE VERY GOOD WHEN THE AIR GROWSCHILLY LATE AT NIGHT  ONLY THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE  BUT I HAVE DISCOVEREDA PLACE WHERE I CAN GET THREE FOR TEN CENTS  THEY ARE NOT SO GOOD AS THEOTHERS  BUT THEY ARE VERY WARMING        A MEXICAN DISH  REFERRED TO OCCASIONALLY IN THE LITERATURE     OF THE TIMES   IT IS SUPPOSED THAT IT WAS WARMLY SEASONED      NO RECIPE OF IT HAS COME DOWN TO US  AND SO I HAVE AT LAST FOUND MY WORK IN THE WORLD  THANKS TO YOU  YOUNGMAN  IT IS THE MASTER S WORK   HE LOOKED AT ME  AND HIS EYES TWINKLED  YOU CAUGHT ME FEEDING HIS LAMBS  YOU KNOW  AND OF COURSE YOU WILL ALLKEEP MY SECRET  HE SPOKE CARELESSLY ENOUGH  BUT THERE WAS REAL FEAR BEHIND THE SPEECH HE PROMISED TO CALL UPON US AGAIN  BUT A WEEK LATER WE READ IN THENEWSPAPER OF THE SAD CASE OF BISHOP MOREHOUSE  WHO HAD BEEN COMMITTED TOTHE NAPA ASYLUM AND FOR WHOM THERE WERE STILL HOPES HELD OUT  IN VAINWE TRIED TO SEE HIM  TO HAVE HIS CASE RECONSIDERED OR INVESTIGATED  NORCOULD WE LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THE REITERATED STATEMENTS THATSLIGHT HOPES WERE STILL HELD FOR HIS RECOVERY  CHRIST TOLD THE RICH YOUNG MAN TO SELL ALL HE HAD   ERNEST SAIDBITTERLY   THE BISHOP OBEYED CHRIST S INJUNCTION AND GOT LOCKED UP IN AMADHOUSE  TIMES HAVE CHANGED SINCE CHRIST S DAY  A RICH MAN TO DAY WHOGIVES ALL HE HAS TO THE POOR IS CRAZY  THERE IS NO DISCUSSION  SOCIETYHAS SPOKEN  CHAPTER XIIITHE GENERAL STRIKEOF COURSE ERNEST WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN THE GREAT SOCIALISTLANDSLIDE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FALL OF       ONE GREAT FACTOR THATHELPED TO SWELL THE SOCIALIST VOTE WAS THE DESTRUCTION OF HEARST  THIS THE PLUTOCRACY FOUND AN EASY TASK  IT COST HEARST EIGHTEEN MILLIONDOLLARS A YEAR TO RUN HIS VARIOUS PAPERS  AND THIS SUM  AND MORE  HE GOTBACK FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS IN PAYMENT FOR ADVERTISING  THE SOURCE OF HISFINANCIAL STRENGTH LAY WHOLLY IN THE MIDDLE CLASS  THE TRUSTS DID NOTADVERTISE    TO DESTROY HEARST  ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY WAS TO TAKE AWAYFROM HIM HIS ADVERTISING        WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST  A YOUNG CALIFORNIA MILLIONAIRE     WHO BECAME THE MOST POWERFUL NEWSPAPER OWNER IN THE COUNTRY      HIS NEWSPAPERS WERE PUBLISHED IN ALL THE LARGE CITIES  AND     THEY APPEALED TO THE PERISHING MIDDLE CLASS AND TO THE     PROLETARIAT   SO LARGE WAS HIS FOLLOWING THAT HE MANAGED TO     TAKE POSSESSION OF THE EMPTY SHELL OF THE OLD DEMOCRATIC     PARTY   HE OCCUPIED AN ANOMALOUS POSITION  PREACHING AN     EMASCULATED SOCIALISM COMBINED WITH A NONDESCRIPT SORT OF     PETTY BOURGEOIS CAPITALISM   IT WAS OIL AND WATER  AND THERE     WAS NO HOPE FOR HIM  THOUGH FOR A SHORT PERIOD HE WAS A     SOURCE OF SERIOUS APPREHENSION TO THE PLUTOCRATS         THE COST OF ADVERTISING WAS AMAZING IN THOSE HELTER      SKELTER TIMES   ONLY THE SMALL CAPITALISTS COMPETED  AND     THEREFORE THEY DID THE ADVERTISING   THERE BEING NO     COMPETITION WHERE THERE WAS A TRUST  THERE WAS NO NEED FOR     THE TRUSTS TO ADVERTISE THE WHOLE MIDDLE CLASS HAD NOT YET BEEN EXTERMINATED  THE STURDYSKELETON OF IT REMAINED  BUT IT WAS WITHOUT POWER  THE SMALLMANUFACTURERS AND SMALL BUSINESS MEN WHO STILL SURVIVED WERE AT THECOMPLETE MERCY OF THE PLUTOCRACY  THEY HAD NO ECONOMIC NOR POLITICALSOULS OF THEIR OWN  WHEN THE FIAT OF THE PLUTOCRACY WENT FORTH  THEYWITHDREW THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS FROM THE HEARST PAPERS HEARST MADE A GALLANT FIGHT  HE BROUGHT HIS PAPERS OUT AT A LOSS OFA MILLION AND A HALF EACH MONTH  HE CONTINUED TO PUBLISH THEADVERTISEMENTS FOR WHICH HE NO LONGER RECEIVED PAY  AGAIN THE FIAT OFTHE PLUTOCRACY WENT FORTH  AND THE SMALL BUSINESS MEN AND MANUFACTURERSSWAMPED HIM WITH A FLOOD OF NOTICES THAT HE MUST DISCONTINUE RUNNINGTHEIR OLD ADVERTISEMENTS  HEARST PERSISTED  INJUNCTIONS WERE SERVEDON HIM  STILL HE PERSISTED  HE RECEIVED SIX MONTHS  IMPRISONMENT FORCONTEMPT OF COURT IN DISOBEYING THE INJUNCTIONS  WHILE HE WAS BANKRUPTEDBY COUNTLESS DAMAGE SUITS  HE HAD NO CHANCE  THE PLUTOCRACY HAD PASSEDSENTENCE ON HIM  THE COURTS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE PLUTOCRACY TOCARRY THE SENTENCE OUT  AND WITH HEARST CRASHED ALSO TO DESTRUCTION THEDEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT HE HAD SO RECENTLY CAPTURED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF HEARST AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY  THERE WERE ONLYTWO PATHS FOR HIS FOLLOWING TO TAKE  ONE WAS INTO THE SOCIALIST PARTY THE OTHER WAS INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  THEN IT WAS THAT WE SOCIALISTSREAPED THE FRUIT OF HEARST S PSEUDO SOCIALISTIC PREACHING  FOR THE GREATMAJORITY OF HIS FOLLOWERS CAME OVER TO US THE EXPROPRIATION OF THE FARMERS THAT TOOK PLACE AT THIS TIME WOULD ALSOHAVE SWELLED OUR VOTE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE BRIEF AND FUTILE RISE OFTHE GRANGE PARTY  ERNEST AND THE SOCIALIST LEADERS FOUGHT FIERCELY TOCAPTURE THE FARMERS  BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SOCIALIST PRESSAND PUBLISHING HOUSES CONSTITUTED TOO GREAT A HANDICAP  WHILE THEMOUTH TO MOUTH PROPAGANDA HAD NOT YET BEEN PERFECTED  SO IT WAS THATPOLITICIANS LIKE MR  CALVIN  WHO WERE THEMSELVES FARMERS LONG SINCEEXPROPRIATED  CAPTURED THE FARMERS AND THREW THEIR POLITICAL STRENGTHAWAY IN A VAIN CAMPAIGN  THE POOR FARMERS   ERNEST ONCE LAUGHED SAVAGELY   THE TRUSTS HAVE THEMBOTH COMING AND GOING  AND THAT WAS REALLY THE SITUATION  THE SEVEN GREAT TRUSTS  WORKINGTOGETHER  HAD POOLED THEIR ENORMOUS SURPLUSES AND MADE A FARM TRUST THE RAILROADS  CONTROLLING RATES  AND THE BANKERS AND STOCK EXCHANGEGAMESTERS  CONTROLLING PRICES  HAD LONG SINCE BLED THE FARMERS INTOINDEBTEDNESS  THE BANKERS  AND ALL THE TRUSTS FOR THAT MATTER  HADLIKEWISE LONG SINCE LOANED COLOSSAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO THE FARMERS  THEFARMERS WERE IN THE NET  ALL THAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS THE DRAWING INOF THE NET  THIS THE FARM TRUST PROCEEDED TO DO THE HARD TIMES OF      HAD ALREADY CAUSED A FRIGHTFUL SLUMP IN THE FARMMARKETS  PRICES WERE NOW DELIBERATELY PRESSED DOWN TO BANKRUPTCY WHILE THE RAILROADS  WITH EXTORTIONATE RATES  BROKE THE BACK OF THEFARMER CAMEL  THUS THE FARMERS WERE COMPELLED TO BORROW MORE AND MORE WHILE THEY WERE PREVENTED FROM PAYING BACK OLD LOANS  THEN ENSUED THEGREAT FORECLOSING OF MORTGAGES AND ENFORCED COLLECTION OF NOTES  THEFARMERS SIMPLY SURRENDERED THE LAND TO THE FARM TRUST  THERE WAS NOTHINGELSE FOR THEM TO DO  AND HAVING SURRENDERED THE LAND  THE FARMERS NEXTWENT TO WORK FOR THE FARM TRUST  BECOMING MANAGERS  SUPERINTENDENTS FOREMEN  AND COMMON LABORERS  THEY WORKED FOR WAGES  THEY BECAMEVILLEINS  IN SHORT  SERFS BOUND TO THE SOIL BY A LIVING WAGE  THEY COULDNOT LEAVE THEIR MASTERS  FOR THEIR MASTERS COMPOSED THE PLUTOCRACY THEY COULD NOT GO TO THE CITIES  FOR THERE  ALSO  THE PLUTOCRACY WASIN CONTROL  THEY HAD BUT ONE ALTERNATIVE   TO LEAVE THE SOIL AND BECOMEVAGRANTS  IN BRIEF  TO STARVE  AND EVEN THERE THEY WERE FRUSTRATED  FORSTRINGENT VAGRANCY LAWS WERE PASSED AND RIGIDLY ENFORCED OF COURSE  HERE AND THERE  FARMERS  AND EVEN WHOLE COMMUNITIES OFFARMERS  ESCAPED EXPROPRIATION BY VIRTUE OF EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS  BUTTHEY WERE MERELY STRAYS AND DID NOT COUNT  AND THEY WERE GATHERED INANYWAY DURING THE FOLLOWING YEAR         THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN YEOMANRY PROCEEDED FAR LESS     RAPIDLY THAN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN FARMERS AND     SMALL CAPITALISTS  THERE WAS MOMENTUM IN THE TWENTIETH     CENTURY  WHILE THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NONE IN ANCIENT ROME      NUMBERS OF THE FARMERS  IMPELLED BY AN INSANE LUST FOR THE     SOIL  AND WILLING TO SHOW WHAT BEASTS THEY COULD BECOME      TRIED TO ESCAPE EXPROPRIATION BY WITHDRAWING FROM ANY AND     ALL MARKET DEALING   THEY SOLD NOTHING   THEY BOUGHT     NOTHING   AMONG THEMSELVES A PRIMITIVE BARTER BEGAN TO     SPRING UP   THEIR PRIVATION AND HARDSHIPS WERE TERRIBLE  BUT     THEY PERSISTED   IT BECAME QUITE A MOVEMENT  IN FACT  THE     MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE BEATEN WAS UNIQUE AND LOGICAL AND     SIMPLE   THE PLUTOCRACY  BY VIRTUE OF ITS POSSESSION OF THE     GOVERNMENT  RAISED THEIR TAXES   IT WAS THE WEAK JOINT IN     THEIR ARMOR   NEITHER BUYING NOR SELLING  THEY HAD NO MONEY      AND IN THE END THEIR LAND WAS SOLD TO PAY THE TAXES THUS IT WAS THAT IN THE FALL OF      THE SOCIALIST LEADERS  WITH THEEXCEPTION OF ERNEST  DECIDED THAT THE END OF CAPITALISM HAD COME  WHATOF THE HARD TIMES AND THE CONSEQUENT VAST ARMY OF THE UNEMPLOYED  WHATOF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FARMERS AND THE MIDDLE CLASS  AND WHAT OF THEDECISIVE DEFEAT ADMINISTERED ALL ALONG THE LINE TO THE LABOR UNIONS  THESOCIALISTS WERE REALLY JUSTIFIED IN BELIEVING THAT THE END OF CAPITALISMHAD COME AND IN THEMSELVES THROWING DOWN THE GAUNTLET TO THE PLUTOCRACY ALAS  HOW WE UNDERESTIMATED THE STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY  EVERYWHERE THESOCIALISTS PROCLAIMED THEIR COMING VICTORY AT THE BALLOT BOX  WHILE  INUNMISTAKABLE TERMS  THEY STATED THE SITUATION  THE PLUTOCRACY ACCEPTEDTHE CHALLENGE  IT WAS THE PLUTOCRACY  WEIGHING AND BALANCING  THATDEFEATED US BY DIVIDING OUR STRENGTH  IT WAS THE PLUTOCRACY  THROUGH ITSSECRET AGENTS  THAT RAISED THE CRY THAT SOCIALISM WAS SACRILEGIOUSAND ATHEISTIC  IT WAS THE PLUTOCRACY THAT WHIPPED THE CHURCHES  ANDESPECIALLY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  INTO LINE  AND ROBBED US OF A PORTION OFTHE LABOR VOTE  AND IT WAS THE PLUTOCRACY  THROUGH ITS SECRET AGENTSOF COURSE  THAT ENCOURAGED THE GRANGE PARTY AND EVEN SPREAD IT TO THECITIES INTO THE RANKS OF THE DYING MIDDLE CLASS NEVERTHELESS THE SOCIALIST LANDSLIDE OCCURRED  BUT  INSTEAD OF ASWEEPING VICTORY WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND MAJORITIES IN ALLLEGISLATIVE BODIES  WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MINORITY  IT IS TRUE  WEELECTED FIFTY CONGRESSMEN  BUT WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR SEATS IN THE SPRINGOF       THEY FOUND THEMSELVES WITHOUT POWER OF ANY SORT  YET THEYWERE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THE GRANGERS  WHO CAPTURED A DOZEN STATEGOVERNMENTS  AND WHO  IN THE SPRING  WERE NOT PERMITTED TO TAKEPOSSESSION OF THE CAPTURED OFFICES  THE INCUMBENTS REFUSED TO RETIRE AND THE COURTS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE OLIGARCHY  BUT THIS IS TOO FARIN ADVANCE OF EVENTS  I HAVE YET TO TELL OF THE STIRRING TIMES OF THEWINTER OF      THE HARD TIMES AT HOME HAD CAUSED AN IMMENSE DECREASE IN CONSUMPTION LABOR  OUT OF WORK  HAD NO WAGES WITH WHICH TO BUY  THE RESULT WAS THATTHE PLUTOCRACY FOUND A GREATER SURPLUS THAN EVER ON ITS HANDS  THISSURPLUS IT WAS COMPELLED TO DISPOSE OF ABROAD  AND  WHAT OF ITS COLOSSALPLANS  IT NEEDED MONEY  BECAUSE OF ITS STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO DISPOSE OFTHE SURPLUS IN THE WORLD MARKET  THE PLUTOCRACY CLASHED WITH GERMANY ECONOMIC CLASHES WERE USUALLY SUCCEEDED BY WARS  AND THIS PARTICULARCLASH WAS NO EXCEPTION  THE GREAT GERMAN WAR LORD PREPARED  AND SO DIDTHE UNITED STATES PREPARE THE WAR CLOUD HOVERED DARK AND OMINOUS  THE STAGE WAS SET FOR AWORLD CATASTROPHE  FOR IN ALL THE WORLD WERE HARD TIMES  LABOR TROUBLES PERISHING MIDDLE CLASSES  ARMIES OF UNEMPLOYED  CLASHES OF ECONOMICINTERESTS IN THE WORLD MARKET  AND MUTTERINGS AND RUMBLINGS OF THESOCIALIST REVOLUTION         FOR A LONG TIME THESE MUTTERINGS AND RUMBLINGS HAD BEEN     HEARD  AS FAR BACK AS      A D   LORD AVEBURY  AN     ENGLISHMAN  UTTERED THE FOLLOWING IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS       THE UNREST IN EUROPE  THE SPREAD OF SOCIALISM  AND THE     OMINOUS RISE OF ANARCHISM  ARE WARNINGS TO THE GOVERNMENTS     AND THE RULING CLASSES THAT THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING     CLASSES IN EUROPE IS BECOMING INTOLERABLE  AND THAT IF A     REVOLUTION IS TO BE AVOIDED SOME STEPS MUST BE TAKEN TO     INCREASE WAGES  REDUCE THE HOURS OF LABOR  AND LOWER THE     PRICES OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE    THE WALL STREET     JOURNAL  A STOCK GAMESTERS  PUBLICATION  IN COMMENTING UPON     LORD AVEBURY S SPEECH  SAID   THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN BY AN     ARISTOCRAT AND A MEMBER OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE BODY IN ALL     EUROPE   THAT GIVES THEM ALL THE MORE SIGNIFICANCE   THEY     CONTAIN MORE VALUABLE POLITICAL ECONOMY THAN IS TO BE FOUND     IN MOST OF THE BOOKS   THEY SOUND A NOTE OF WARNING  TAKE     HEED  GENTLEMEN OF THE WAR AND NAVY DEPARTMENTS       AT THE SAME TIME  SYDNEY BROOKS  WRITING IN AMERICA  IN     HARPER S WEEKLY  SAID   YOU WILL NOT HEAR THE SOCIALISTS     MENTIONED IN WASHINGTON   WHY SHOULD YOU   THE POLITICIANS     ARE ALWAYS THE LAST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY TO SEE WHAT IS     GOING ON UNDER THEIR NOSES  THEY WILL JEER AT ME WHEN I     PROPHESY  AND PROPHESY WITH THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE  THAT AT     THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE SOCIALISTS WILL POLL OVER     A MILLION VOTES  THE OLIGARCHY WANTED THE WAR WITH GERMANY  AND IT WANTED THE WAR FOR ADOZEN REASONS  IN THE JUGGLING OF EVENTS SUCH A WAR WOULD CAUSE  IN THERESHUFFLING OF THE INTERNATIONAL CARDS AND THE MAKING OF NEW TREATIESAND ALLIANCES  THE OLIGARCHY HAD MUCH TO GAIN  AND  FURTHERMORE  THE WARWOULD CONSUME MANY NATIONAL SURPLUSES  REDUCE THE ARMIES OF UNEMPLOYEDTHAT MENACED ALL COUNTRIES  AND GIVE THE OLIGARCHY A BREATHING SPACEIN WHICH TO PERFECT ITS PLANS AND CARRY THEM OUT  SUCH A WAR WOULDVIRTUALLY PUT THE OLIGARCHY IN POSSESSION OF THE WORLD MARKET  ALSO SUCH A WAR WOULD CREATE A LARGE STANDING ARMY THAT NEED NEVER BEDISBANDED  WHILE IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE SUBSTITUTEDTHE ISSUE   AMERICA VERSUS GERMANY   IN PLACE OF  SOCIALISM VERSUSOLIGARCHY  AND TRULY THE WAR WOULD HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS HAD IT NOT BEEN FORTHE SOCIALISTS  A SECRET MEETING OF THE WESTERN LEADERS WAS HELD IN OURFOUR TINY ROOMS IN PELL STREET  HERE WAS FIRST CONSIDERED THE STAND THESOCIALISTS WERE TO TAKE  IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE HAD PUT OUR FOOTDOWN UPON WAR   BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD DONE SO IN THE UNITEDSTATES  AFTER OUR SECRET MEETING WE GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE NATIONALORGANIZATION  AND SOON OUR CODE CABLES WERE PASSING BACK AND FORTHACROSS THE ATLANTIC BETWEEN US AND THE INTERNATIONAL BUREAU        IT WAS AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY     A D   THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE SOCIALISTS     FINALLY FORMULATED THEIR LONG MATURING POLICY ON WAR      EPITOMIZED THEIR DOCTRINE WAS   WHY SHOULD THE WORKINGMEN OF     ONE COUNTRY FIGHT WITH THE WORKINGMEN OF ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR     THE BENEFIT OF THEIR CAPITALIST MASTERS       ON MAY          A D   WHEN WAR THREATENED BETWEEN AUSTRIA     AND ITALY  THE SOCIALISTS OF ITALY  AUSTRIA  AND HUNGARY     HELD A CONFERENCE AT TRIESTE  AND THREATENED A GENERAL     STRIKE OF THE WORKINGMEN OF BOTH COUNTRIES IN CASE WAR WAS     DECLARED   THIS WAS REPEATED THE FOLLOWING YEAR  WHEN THE      MOROCCO AFFAIR  THREATENED TO INVOLVE FRANCE  GERMANY  AND     ENGLAND THE GERMAN SOCIALISTS WERE READY TO ACT WITH US  THERE WERE OVER FIVEMILLION OF THEM  MANY OF THEM IN THE STANDING ARMY  AND  IN ADDITION THEY WERE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE LABOR UNIONS  IN BOTH COUNTRIES THESOCIALISTS CAME OUT IN BOLD DECLARATION AGAINST THE WAR AND THREATENEDTHE GENERAL STRIKE  AND IN THE MEANTIME THEY MADE PREPARATION FOR THEGENERAL STRIKE  FURTHERMORE  THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES IN ALL COUNTRIESGAVE PUBLIC UTTERANCE TO THE SOCIALIST PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACETHAT MUST BE PRESERVED AT ALL HAZARDS  EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF REVOLT ANDREVOLUTION AT HOME THE GENERAL STRIKE WAS THE ONE GREAT VICTORY WE AMERICAN SOCIALISTSWON  ON THE  TH OF DECEMBER THE AMERICAN MINISTER WAS WITHDRAWN FROMTHE GERMAN CAPITAL  THAT NIGHT A GERMAN FLEET MADE A DASH ON HONOLULU SINKING THREE AMERICAN CRUISERS AND A REVENUE CUTTER  AND BOMBARDINGTHE CITY  NEXT DAY BOTH GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES DECLARED WAR AND WITHIN AN HOUR THE SOCIALISTS CALLED THE GENERAL STRIKE IN BOTHCOUNTRIES FOR THE FIRST TIME THE GERMAN WAR LORD FACED THE MEN OF HIS EMPIREWHO MADE HIS EMPIRE GO  WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE  THENOVELTY OF THE SITUATION LAY IN THAT THEIR REVOLT WAS PASSIVE  THEYDID NOT FIGHT  THEY DID NOTHING  AND BY DOING NOTHING THEY TIED THEIRWAR LORD S HANDS  HE WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN ANOPPORTUNITY TO LOOSE HIS WAR DOGS ON HIS REBELLIOUS PROLETARIAT  BUTTHIS WAS DENIED HIM  HE COULD NOT LOOSE HIS WAR DOGS  NEITHER COULDHE MOBILIZE HIS ARMY TO GO FORTH TO WAR  NOR COULD HE PUNISH HISRECALCITRANT SUBJECTS  NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE  NOT A TRAIN RAN NOT A TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE WENT OVER THE WIRES  FOR THE TELEGRAPHERS ANDRAILROAD MEN HAD CEASED WORK ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE POPULATION AND AS IT WAS IN GERMANY  SO IT WAS IN THE UNITED STATES  AT LASTORGANIZED LABOR HAD LEARNED ITS LESSON  BEATEN DECISIVELY ON ITS OWNCHOSEN FIELD  IT HAD ABANDONED THAT FIELD AND COME OVER TO THE POLITICALFIELD OF THE SOCIALISTS  FOR THE GENERAL STRIKE WAS A POLITICAL STRIKE BESIDES  ORGANIZED LABOR HAD BEEN SO BADLY BEATEN THAT IT DID NOT CARE IT JOINED IN THE GENERAL STRIKE OUT OF SHEER DESPERATION  THE WORKERSTHREW DOWN THEIR TOOLS AND LEFT THEIR TASKS BY THE MILLIONS  ESPECIALLYNOTABLE WERE THE MACHINISTS  THEIR HEADS WERE BLOODY  THEIR ORGANIZATIONHAD APPARENTLY BEEN DESTROYED  YET OUT THEY CAME  ALONG WITH THEIRALLIES IN THE METAL WORKING TRADES EVEN THE COMMON LABORERS AND ALL UNORGANIZED LABOR CEASED WORK  THESTRIKE HAD TIED EVERYTHING UP SO THAT NOBODY COULD WORK  BESIDES  THEWOMEN PROVED TO BE THE STRONGEST PROMOTERS OF THE STRIKE  THEY SET THEIRFACES AGAINST THE WAR  THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR MEN TO GO FORTH TODIE  THEN  ALSO  THE IDEA OF THE GENERAL STRIKE CAUGHT THE MOOD OF THEPEOPLE  IT STRUCK THEIR SENSE OF HUMOR  THE IDEA WAS INFECTIOUS  THECHILDREN STRUCK IN ALL THE SCHOOLS  AND SUCH TEACHERS AS CAME  WENT HOMEAGAIN FROM DESERTED CLASS ROOMS  THE GENERAL STRIKE TOOK THE FORM OFA GREAT NATIONAL PICNIC  AND THE IDEA OF THE SOLIDARITY OF LABOR  SOEVIDENCED  APPEALED TO THE IMAGINATION OF ALL  AND  FINALLY  THERE WASNO DANGER TO BE INCURRED BY THE COLOSSAL FROLIC  WHEN EVERYBODY WASGUILTY  HOW WAS ANYBODY TO BE PUNISHED THE UNITED STATES WAS PARALYZED  NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING  THEREWERE NO NEWSPAPERS  NO LETTERS  NO DESPATCHES  EVERY COMMUNITY WAS ASCOMPLETELY ISOLATED AS THOUGH TEN THOUSAND MILES OF PRIMEVAL WILDERNESSSTRETCHED BETWEEN IT AND THE REST OF THE WORLD  FOR THAT MATTER  THEWORLD HAD CEASED TO EXIST  AND FOR A WEEK THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS WASMAINTAINED IN SAN FRANCISCO WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING EVEN ACROSS THE BAYIN OAKLAND OR BERKELEY  THE EFFECT ON ONE S SENSIBILITIES WAS WEIRD DEPRESSING  IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME GREAT COSMIC THING LAY DEAD  THEPULSE OF THE LAND HAD CEASED TO BEAT  OF A TRUTH THE NATION HAD DIED THERE WERE NO WAGONS RUMBLING ON THE STREETS  NO FACTORY WHISTLES  NOHUM OF ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR  NO PASSING OF STREET CARS  NO CRIESOF NEWS BOYS  NOTHING BUT PERSONS WHO AT RARE INTERVALS WENT BY LIKEFURTIVE GHOSTS  THEMSELVES OPPRESSED AND MADE UNREAL BY THE SILENCE AND DURING THAT WEEK OF SILENCE THE OLIGARCHY WAS TAUGHT ITS LESSON  ANDWELL IT LEARNED THE LESSON  THE GENERAL STRIKE WAS A WARNING  IT SHOULDNEVER OCCUR AGAIN  THE OLIGARCHY WOULD SEE TO THAT AT THE END OF THE WEEK  AS HAD BEEN PREARRANGED  THE TELEGRAPHERS OFGERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES RETURNED TO THEIR POSTS  THROUGH THEM THESOCIALIST LEADERS OF BOTH COUNTRIES PRESENTED THEIR ULTIMATUM TO THERULERS  THE WAR SHOULD BE CALLED OFF  OR THE GENERAL STRIKE WOULDCONTINUE  IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING  THE WAR WASDECLARED OFF  AND THE POPULATIONS OF BOTH COUNTRIES RETURNED TO THEIRTASKS IT WAS THIS RENEWAL OF PEACE THAT BROUGHT ABOUT THE ALLIANCE BETWEENGERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES  IN REALITY  THIS WAS AN ALLIANCE BETWEENTHE EMPEROR AND THE OLIGARCHY  FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING THEIR COMMONFOE  THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT OF BOTH COUNTRIES  AND IT WAS THISALLIANCE THAT THE OLIGARCHY AFTERWARD SO TREACHEROUSLY BROKE WHEN THEGERMAN SOCIALISTS ROSE AND DROVE THE WAR LORD FROM HIS THRONE  IT WASTHE VERY THING THE OLIGARCHY HAD PLAYED FOR  THE DESTRUCTION OF ITSGREAT RIVAL IN THE WORLD MARKET  WITH THE GERMAN EMPEROR OUT OF THE WAY GERMANY WOULD HAVE NO SURPLUS TO SELL ABROAD  BY THE VERY NATURE OFTHE SOCIALIST STATE  THE GERMAN POPULATION WOULD CONSUME ALL THAT ITPRODUCED  OF COURSE  IT WOULD TRADE ABROAD CERTAIN THINGS IT PRODUCEDFOR THINGS IT DID NOT PRODUCE  BUT THIS WOULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANUNCONSUMABLE SURPLUS  I LL WAGER THE OLIGARCHY FINDS JUSTIFICATION   ERNEST SAID  WHEN ITSTREACHERY TO THE GERMAN EMPEROR BECAME KNOWN   AS USUAL  THE OLIGARCHYWILL BELIEVE IT HAS DONE RIGHT  AND SURE ENOUGH  THE OLIGARCHY S PUBLIC DEFENCE FOR THE ACT WAS THAT ITHAD DONE IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHOSE INTERESTS IT WASLOOKING OUT FOR  IT HAD FLUNG ITS HATED RIVAL OUT OF THE WORLD MARKETAND ENABLED US TO DISPOSE OF OUR SURPLUS IN THAT MARKET  AND THE HOWLING FOLLY OF IT IS THAT WE ARE SO HELPLESS THAT SUCH IDIOTSREALLY ARE MANAGING OUR INTERESTS   WAS ERNEST S COMMENT   THEY HAVEENABLED US TO SELL MORE ABROAD  WHICH MEANS THAT WE LL BE COMPELLED TOCONSUME LESS AT HOME  CHAPTER XIVTHE BEGINNING OF THE ENDAS EARLY AS JANUARY        ERNEST SAW THE TRUE TREND OF AFFAIRS  BUTHE COULD NOT GET HIS BROTHER LEADERS TO SEE THE VISION OF THE IRONHEEL THAT HAD ARISEN IN HIS BRAIN  THEY WERE TOO CONFIDENT  EVENTS WERERUSHING TOO RAPIDLY TO CULMINATION  A CRISIS HAD COME IN WORLDAFFAIRS  THE AMERICAN OLIGARCHY WAS PRACTICALLY IN POSSESSION OF THEWORLD MARKET  AND SCORES OF COUNTRIES WERE FLUNG OUT OF THAT MARKET WITHUNCONSUMABLE AND UNSALABLE SURPLUSES ON THEIR HANDS  FOR SUCH COUNTRIESNOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION  THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIRMETHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES  THE CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM  SO FAR AS THEYWERE CONCERNED  HAD HOPELESSLY BROKEN DOWN THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION IT WAS A TIME OF CONFUSION AND VIOLENCE  EVERYWHERE INSTITUTIONS ANDGOVERNMENTS WERE CRASHING  EVERYWHERE  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO ORTHREE COUNTRIES  THE ERSTWHILE CAPITALIST MASTERS FOUGHT BITTERLY FORTHEIR POSSESSIONS  BUT THE GOVERNMENTS WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM BY THEMILITANT PROLETARIAT  AT LAST WAS BEING REALIZED KARL MARX S CLASSIC  THE KNELL OF PRIVATE CAPITALIST PROPERTY SOUNDS  THE EXPROPRIATORSARE EXPROPRIATED   AND AS FAST AS CAPITALISTIC GOVERNMENTS CRASHED COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTHS AROSE IN THEIR PLACE  WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES LAG BEHIND     GET BUSY  YOU AMERICANREVOLUTIONISTS     WHAT S THE MATTER WITH AMERICA    WERE THE MESSAGESSENT TO US BY OUR SUCCESSFUL COMRADES IN OTHER LANDS  BUT WE COULD NOTKEEP UP  THE OLIGARCHY STOOD IN THE WAY  ITS BULK  LIKE THAT OF SOMEHUGE MONSTER  BLOCKED OUR PATH  WAIT TILL WE TAKE OFFICE IN THE SPRING   WE ANSWERED   THEN YOU LLSEE  BEHIND THIS LAY OUR SECRET  WE HAD WON OVER THE GRANGERS  AND IN THESPRING A DOZEN STATES WOULD PASS INTO THEIR HANDS BY VIRTUE OF THEELECTIONS OF THE PRECEDING FALL  AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZENCOOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES  AFTER THAT  THE REST WOULD BE EASY  BUT WHAT IF THE GRANGERS FAIL TO GET POSSESSION   ERNEST DEMANDED  ANDHIS COMRADES CALLED HIM A CALAMITY HOWLER BUT THIS FAILURE TO GET POSSESSION WAS NOT THE CHIEF DANGER THAT ERNESTHAD IN MIND  WHAT HE FORESAW WAS THE DEFECTION OF THE GREAT LABOR UNIONSAND THE RISE OF THE CASTES  GHENT HAS TAUGHT THE OLIGARCHS HOW TO DO IT   ERNEST SAID   I LL WAGERTHEY VE MADE A TEXT BOOK OUT OF HIS  BENEVOLENT FEUDALISM            OUR BENEVOLENT FEUDALISM   A BOOK PUBLISHED IN      A D       BY W  J  GHENT   IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN INSISTED THAT GHENT PUT     THE IDEA OF THE OLIGARCHY INTO THE MINDS OF THE GREAT     CAPITALISTS   THIS BELIEF PERSISTS THROUGHOUT THE LITERATURE     OF THE THREE CENTURIES OF THE IRON HEEL  AND EVEN IN THE     LITERATURE OF THE FIRST CENTURY OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN      TO DAY WE KNOW BETTER  BUT OUR KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT OVERCOME     THE FACT THAT GHENT REMAINS THE MOST ABUSED INNOCENT MAN IN     ALL HISTORY NEVER SHALL I FORGET THE NIGHT WHEN  AFTER A HOT DISCUSSION WITH HALF ADOZEN LABOR LEADERS  ERNEST TURNED TO ME AND SAID QUIETLY   THAT SETTLESIT  THE IRON HEEL HAS WON  THE END IS IN SIGHT  THIS LITTLE CONFERENCE IN OUR HOME WAS UNOFFICIAL  BUT ERNEST  LIKE THEREST OF HIS COMRADES  WAS WORKING FOR ASSURANCES FROM THE LABOR LEADERSTHAT THEY WOULD CALL OUT THEIR MEN IN THE NEXT GENERAL STRIKE  O CONNOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS  HAD BEEN FOREMOST OF THESIX LEADERS PRESENT IN REFUSING TO GIVE SUCH ASSURANCE  YOU HAVE SEEN THAT YOU WERE BEATEN SOUNDLY AT YOUR OLD TACTICS OFSTRIKE AND BOYCOTT   ERNEST

LEAVING THE BATTLE FIELD LIKE COWARDS   I M NOT SAYING ANYTHING   O CONNOR ANSWERED SULLENLY   ONLY I GUESS WEKNOW WHAT S BEST FOR US A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU DO   AND YOU DON T CARE A CENT FOR WHAT IS BEST FOR THE REST OF LABOR  YOUKICK IT INTO THE DITCH   I M NOT SAYING ANYTHING   O CONNOR REPLIED   EXCEPT THAT I M PRESIDENTOF THE MACHINISTS  ASSOCIATION  AND IT S MY BUSINESS TO CONSIDER THEINTERESTS OF THE MEN I REPRESENT  THAT S ALL  AND THEN  WHEN THE LABOR LEADERS HAD LEFT  ERNEST  WITH THE CALMNESS OFDEFEAT  OUTLINED TO ME THE COURSE OF EVENTS TO COME  THE SOCIALISTS USED TO FORETELL WITH JOY   HE SAID   THE COMING OF THEDAY WHEN ORGANIZED LABOR  DEFEATED ON THE INDUSTRIAL FIELD  WOULD COMEOVER ON TO THE POLITICAL FIELD  WELL  THE IRON HEEL HAS DEFEATEDTHE LABOR UNIONS ON THE INDUSTRIAL FIELD AND DRIVEN THEM OVER TO THEPOLITICAL FIELD  AND INSTEAD OF THIS BEING JOYFUL FOR US  IT WILL BEA SOURCE OF GRIEF  THE IRON HEEL LEARNED ITS LESSON  WE SHOWED IT OURPOWER IN THE GENERAL STRIKE  IT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO PREVENT ANOTHERGENERAL STRIKE   BUT HOW   I ASKED  SIMPLY BY SUBSIDIZING THE GREAT UNIONS  THEY WON T JOIN IN THE NEXTGENERAL STRIKE  THEREFORE IT WON T BE A GENERAL STRIKE   BUT THE IRON HEEL CAN T MAINTAIN SO COSTLY A PROGRAMME FOREVER   IOBJECTED  OH  IT HASN T SUBSIDIZED ALL OF THE UNIONS  THAT S NOT NECESSARY  HEREIS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN  WAGES ARE GOING TO BE ADVANCED AND HOURSSHORTENED IN THE RAILROAD UNIONS  THE IRON AND STEEL WORKERS UNIONS AND THE ENGINEER AND MACHINIST UNIONS  IN THESE UNIONS MORE FAVORABLECONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO PREVAIL  MEMBERSHIP IN THESE UNIONS WILLBECOME LIKE SEATS IN PARADISE   STILL I DON T SEE   I OBJECTED   WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THE OTHER UNIONS THERE ARE FAR MORE UNIONS OUTSIDE OF THIS COMBINATION THAN IN IT   THE OTHER UNIONS WILL BE GROUND OUT OF EXISTENCE  ALL OF THEM  FOR DON T YOU SEE  THE RAILWAY MEN  MACHINISTS AND ENGINEERS  IRON ANDSTEEL WORKERS  DO ALL OF THE VITALLY ESSENTIAL WORK IN OUR MACHINECIVILIZATION  ASSURED OF THEIR FAITHFULNESS  THE IRON HEEL CAN SNAPITS FINGERS AT ALL THE REST OF LABOR  IRON  STEEL  COAL  MACHINERY  ANDTRANSPORTATION CONSTITUTE THE BACKBONE OF THE WHOLE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC   BUT COAL   I QUERIED   THERE ARE NEARLY A MILLION COAL MINERS  THEY ARE PRACTICALLY UNSKILLED LABOR  THEY WILL NOT COUNT  THEIR WAGESWILL GO DOWN AND THEIR HOURS WILL INCREASE  THEY WILL BE SLAVES LIKE ALLTHE REST OF US  AND THEY WILL BECOME ABOUT THE MOST BESTIAL OF ALL OFUS  THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO WORK  JUST AS THE FARMERS ARE COMPELLEDTO WORK NOW FOR THE MASTERS WHO ROBBED THEM OF THEIR LAND  AND THE SAMEWITH ALL THE OTHER UNIONS OUTSIDE THE COMBINATION  WATCH THEM WOBBLE ANDGO TO PIECES  AND THEIR MEMBERS BECOME SLAVES DRIVEN TO TOIL BY EMPTYSTOMACHS AND THE LAW OF THE LAND  DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO FARLEY  AND HIS STRIKE BREAKERS  I LLTELL YOU  STRIKE BREAKING AS AN OCCUPATION WILL CEASE  THERE WON T BEANY MORE STRIKES  IN PLACE OF STRIKES WILL BE SLAVE REVOLTS  FARLEY ANDHIS GANG WILL BE PROMOTED TO SLAVE DRIVING  OH  IT WON T BE CALLEDTHAT  IT WILL BE CALLED ENFORCING THE LAW OF THE LAND THAT COMPELS THELABORERS TO WORK  IT SIMPLY PROLONGS THE FIGHT  THIS TREACHERY OF THEBIG UNIONS  HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS NOW WHERE AND WHEN THE REVOLUTION WILLTRIUMPH         JAMES FARLEY  A NOTORIOUS STRIKE BREAKER OF THE PERIOD   A     MAN MORE COURAGEOUS THAN ETHICAL  AND OF UNDENIABLE ABILITY      HE ROSE HIGH UNDER THE RULE OF THE IRON HEEL AND FINALLY WAS     TRANSLATED INTO THE OLIGARCH CLASS   HE WAS ASSASSINATED IN          BY SARAH JENKINS  WHOSE HUSBAND  THIRTY YEARS BEFORE      HAD BEEN KILLED BY FARLEY S STRIKE BREAKERS  BUT WITH SUCH A POWERFUL COMBINATION AS THE OLIGARCHY AND THE BIGUNIONS  IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE REVOLUTION WILL EVERTRIUMPH   I QUERIED   MAY NOT THE COMBINATION ENDURE FOREVER  HE SHOOK HIS HEAD   ONE OF OUR GENERALIZATIONS IS THAT EVERY SYSTEMFOUNDED UPON CLASS AND CASTE CONTAINS WITHIN ITSELF THE GERMS OF ITS OWNDECAY  WHEN A SYSTEM IS FOUNDED UPON CLASS  HOW CAN CASTE BE PREVENTED THE IRON HEEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT IT  AND IN THE END CASTE WILLDESTROY THE IRON HEEL  THE OLIGARCHS HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED CASTE AMONGTHEMSELVES  BUT WAIT UNTIL THE FAVORED UNIONS DEVELOP CASTE  THE IRONHEEL WILL USE ALL ITS POWER TO PREVENT IT  BUT IT WILL FAIL  IN THE FAVORED UNIONS ARE THE FLOWER OF THE AMERICAN WORKINGMEN  THEYARE STRONG  EFFICIENT MEN  THEY HAVE BECOME MEMBERS OF THOSE UNIONSTHROUGH COMPETITION FOR PLACE  EVERY FIT WORKMAN IN THE UNITED STATESWILL BE POSSESSED BY THE AMBITION TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE FAVOREDUNIONS  THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENTCOMPETITION  THUS WILL THE STRONG MEN  WHO MIGHT ELSE BE REVOLUTIONISTS BE WON AWAY AND THEIR STRENGTH USED TO BOLSTER THE OLIGARCHY  ON THE OTHER HAND  THE LABOR CASTES  THE MEMBERS OF THE FAVORED UNIONS WILL STRIVE TO MAKE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS INTO CLOSE CORPORATIONS AND THEY WILL SUCCEED  MEMBERSHIP IN THE LABOR CASTES WILL BECOMEHEREDITARY  SONS WILL SUCCEED FATHERS  AND THERE WILL BE NO INFLOW OFNEW STRENGTH FROM THAT ETERNAL RESERVOIR OF STRENGTH  THE COMMON PEOPLE THIS WILL MEAN DETERIORATION OF THE LABOR CASTES  AND IN THE END THEYWILL BECOME WEAKER AND WEAKER  AT THE SAME TIME  AS AN INSTITUTION  THEYWILL BECOME TEMPORARILY ALL POWERFUL  THEY WILL BE LIKE THE GUARDS OFTHE PALACE IN OLD ROME  AND THERE WILL BE PALACE REVOLUTIONS WHEREBYTHE LABOR CASTES WILL SEIZE THE REINS OF POWER  AND THERE WILL BECOUNTER PALACE REVOLUTIONS OF THE OLIGARCHS  AND SOMETIMES THE ONE  ANDSOMETIMES THE OTHER  WILL BE IN POWER  AND THROUGH IT ALL THE INEVITABLECASTE WEAKENING WILL GO ON  SO THAT IN THE END THE COMMON PEOPLE WILLCOME INTO THEIR OWN  THIS FORESHADOWING OF A SLOW SOCIAL EVOLUTION WAS MADE WHEN ERNEST WASFIRST DEPRESSED BY THE DEFECTION OF THE GREAT UNIONS  I NEVER AGREEDWITH HIM IN IT  AND I DISAGREE NOW  AS I WRITE THESE LINES  MOREHEARTILY THAN EVER  FOR EVEN NOW  THOUGH ERNEST IS GONE  WE ARE ON THEVERGE OF THE REVOLT THAT WILL SWEEP ALL OLIGARCHIES AWAY  YET I HAVEHERE GIVEN ERNEST S PROPHECY BECAUSE IT WAS HIS PROPHECY  IN SPITE OFHIS BELIEF IN IT  HE WORKED LIKE A GIANT AGAINST IT  AND HE  MORE THANANY MAN  HAS MADE POSSIBLE THE REVOLT THAT EVEN NOW WAITS THE SIGNAL TOBURST FORTH         EVERHARD S SOCIAL FORESIGHT WAS REMARKABLE   AS CLEARLY AS     IN THE LIGHT OF PAST EVENTS  HE SAW THE DEFECTION OF THE     FAVORED UNIONS  THE RISE AND THE SLOW DECAY OF THE LABOR     CASTES  AND THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE DECAYING OLIGARCHS AND     LABOR CASTES FOR CONTROL OF THE GREAT GOVERNMENTAL MACHINE  BUT IF THE OLIGARCHY PERSISTS   I ASKED HIM THAT EVENING   WHAT WILLBECOME OF THE GREAT SURPLUSES THAT WILL FALL TO ITS SHARE EVERY YEAR   THE SURPLUSES WILL HAVE TO BE EXPENDED SOMEHOW   HE ANSWERED   ANDTRUST THE OLIGARCHS TO FIND A WAY  MAGNIFICENT ROADS WILL BE BUILT THERE WILL BE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN SCIENCE  AND ESPECIALLY IN ART  WHENTHE OLIGARCHS HAVE COMPLETELY MASTERED THE PEOPLE  THEY WILL HAVE TIMETO SPARE FOR OTHER THINGS  THEY WILL BECOME WORSHIPPERS OF BEAUTY THEY WILL BECOME ART LOVERS  AND UNDER THEIR DIRECTION AND GENEROUSLYREWARDED  WILL TOIL THE ARTISTS  THE RESULT WILL BE GREAT ART  FOR NOLONGER  AS UP TO YESTERDAY  WILL THE ARTISTS PANDER TO THE BOURGEOISTASTE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS  IT WILL BE GREAT ART  I TELL YOU  AND WONDERCITIES WILL ARISE THAT WILL MAKE TAWDRY AND CHEAP THE CITIES OF OLDTIME  AND IN THESE CITIES WILL THE OLIGARCHS DWELL AND WORSHIP BEAUTY         WE CANNOT BUT MARVEL AT EVERHARD S FORESIGHT   BEFORE EVER     THE THOUGHT OF WONDER CITIES LIKE ARDIS AND ASGARD ENTERED     THE MINDS OF THE OLIGARCHS  EVERHARD SAW THOSE CITIES AND     THE INEVITABLE NECESSITY FOR THEIR CREATION  THUS WILL THE SURPLUS BE CONSTANTLY EXPENDED WHILE LABOR DOES THE WORK THE BUILDING OF THESE GREAT WORKS AND CITIES WILL GIVE A STARVATIONRATION TO MILLIONS OF COMMON LABORERS  FOR THE ENORMOUS BULK OF THESURPLUS WILL COMPEL AN EQUALLY ENORMOUS EXPENDITURE  AND THE OLIGARCHSWILL BUILD FOR A THOUSAND YEARS  AY  FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS  THEY WILLBUILD AS THE EGYPTIANS AND THE BABYLONIANS NEVER DREAMED OF BUILDING AND WHEN THE OLIGARCHS HAVE PASSED AWAY  THEIR GREAT ROADS AND THEIRWONDER CITIES WILL REMAIN FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF LABOR TO TREAD UPON ANDDWELL WITHIN         AND SINCE THAT DAY OF PROPHECY  HAVE PASSED AWAY THE THREE     CENTURIES OF THE IRON HEEL AND THE FOUR CENTURIES OF THE     BROTHERHOOD OF MAN  AND TO DAY WE TREAD THE ROADS AND DWELL     IN THE CITIES THAT THE OLIGARCHS BUILT   IT IS TRUE  WE ARE     EVEN NOW BUILDING STILL MORE WONDERFUL WONDER CITIES  BUT     THE WONDER CITIES OF THE OLIGARCHS ENDURE  AND I WRITE THESE     LINES IN ARDIS  ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL OF THEM ALL  THESE THINGS THE OLIGARCHS WILL DO BECAUSE THEY CANNOT HELP DOING THEM THESE GREAT WORKS WILL BE THE FORM THEIR EXPENDITURE OF THE SURPLUS WILLTAKE  AND IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE RULING CLASSES OF EGYPT OF LONG AGOEXPENDED THE SURPLUS THEY ROBBED FROM THE PEOPLE BY THE BUILDING OFTEMPLES AND PYRAMIDS  UNDER THE OLIGARCHS WILL FLOURISH  NOT A PRIESTCLASS  BUT AN ARTIST CLASS  AND IN PLACE OF THE MERCHANT CLASS OFBOURGEOISIE WILL BE THE LABOR CASTES  AND BENEATH WILL BE THE ABYSS WHEREIN WILL FESTER AND STARVE AND ROT  AND EVER RENEW ITSELF  THECOMMON PEOPLE  THE GREAT BULK OF THE POPULATION  AND IN THE END  WHOKNOWS IN WHAT DAY  THE COMMON PEOPLE WILL RISE UP OUT OF THE ABYSS  THELABOR CASTES AND THE OLIGARCHY WILL CRUMBLE AWAY  AND THEN  AT LAST AFTER THE TRAVAIL OF THE CENTURIES  WILL IT BE THE DAY OF THE COMMONMAN  I HAD THOUGHT TO SEE THAT DAY  BUT NOW I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVERSEE IT  HE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT ME  AND ADDED  SOCIAL EVOLUTION IS EXASPERATINGLY SLOW  ISN T IT  SWEETHEART  MY ARMS WERE ABOUT HIM  AND HIS HEAD WAS ON MY BREAST  SING ME TO SLEEP   HE MURMURED WHIMSICALLY   I HAVE HAD A VISIONING AND I WISH TO FORGET  CHAPTER XVLAST DAYSIT WAS NEAR THE END OF JANUARY        THAT THE CHANGED ATTITUDE OF THEOLIGARCHY TOWARD THE FAVORED UNIONS WAS MADE PUBLIC  THE NEWSPAPERSPUBLISHED INFORMATION OF AN UNPRECEDENTED RISE IN WAGES AND SHORTENINGOF HOURS FOR THE RAILROAD EMPLOYEES  THE IRON AND STEEL WORKERS  ANDTHE ENGINEERS AND MACHINISTS  BUT THE WHOLE TRUTH WAS NOT TOLD  THEOLIGARCHS DID NOT DARE PERMIT THE TELLING OF THE WHOLE TRUTH  INREALITY  THE WAGES HAD BEEN RAISED MUCH HIGHER  AND THE PRIVILEGES WERECORRESPONDINGLY GREATER  ALL THIS WAS SECRET  BUT SECRETS WILL OUT MEMBERS OF THE FAVORED UNIONS TOLD THEIR WIVES  AND THE WIVES GOSSIPED AND SOON ALL THE LABOR WORLD KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED IT WAS MERELY THE LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURYHAD BEEN KNOWN AS GRAB SHARING  IN THE INDUSTRIAL WARFARE OF THAT TIME PROFIT SHARING HAD BEEN TRIED  THAT IS  THE CAPITALISTS HAD STRIVEN TOPLACATE THE WORKERS BY INTERESTING THEM FINANCIALLY IN THEIR WORK BUT PROFIT SHARING  AS A SYSTEM  WAS RIDICULOUS AND IMPOSSIBLE PROFIT SHARING COULD BE SUCCESSFUL ONLY IN ISOLATED CASES IN THE MIDSTOF A SYSTEM OF INDUSTRIAL STRIFE  FOR IF ALL LABOR AND ALL CAPITALSHARED PROFITS  THE SAME CONDITIONS WOULD OBTAIN AS DID OBTAIN WHENTHERE WAS NO PROFIT SHARING SO  OUT OF THE UNPRACTICAL IDEA OF PROFIT SHARING  AROSE THE PRACTICALIDEA OF GRAB SHARING   GIVE US MORE PAY AND CHARGE IT TO THE PUBLIC  WAS THE SLOGAN OF THE STRONG UNIONS   AND HERE AND THERE THIS SELFISHPOLICY WORKED SUCCESSFULLY  IN CHARGING IT TO THE PUBLIC  IT WAS CHARGEDTO THE GREAT MASS OF UNORGANIZED LABOR AND OF WEAKLY ORGANIZED LABOR THESE WORKERS ACTUALLY PAID THE INCREASED WAGES OF THEIR STRONGERBROTHERS WHO WERE MEMBERS OF UNIONS THAT WERE LABOR MONOPOLIES  THISIDEA  AS I SAY  WAS MERELY CARRIED TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION  ON A LARGESCALE  BY THE COMBINATION OF THE OLIGARCHS AND THE FAVORED UNIONS        ALL THE RAILROAD UNIONS ENTERED INTO THIS COMBINATION WITH     THE OLIGARCHS  AND IT IS OF INTEREST TO NOTE THAT THE FIRST     DEFINITE APPLICATION OF THE POLICY OF PROFIT GRABBING WAS     MADE BY A RAILROAD UNION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A D       NAMELY  THE BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS   P  M      ARTHUR WAS FOR TWENTY YEARS GRAND CHIEF OF THE BROTHERHOOD      AFTER THE STRIKE ON THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD IN       HE     BROACHED A SCHEME TO HAVE THE LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS MAKE     TERMS WITH THE RAILROADS AND TO  GO IT ALONE  SO FAR AS THE     REST OF THE LABOR UNIONS WERE CONCERNED   THIS SCHEME WAS     EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL   IT WAS AS SUCCESSFUL AS IT WAS     SELFISH  AND OUT OF IT WAS COINED THE WORD  ARTHURIZATION       TO DENOTE GRAB SHARING ON THE PART OF LABOR UNIONS   THIS     WORD  ARTHURIZATION  HAS LONG PUZZLED THE ETYMOLOGISTS  BUT     ITS DERIVATION  I HOPE  IS NOW MADE CLEAR AS SOON AS THE SECRET OF THE DEFECTION OF THE FAVORED UNIONS LEAKEDOUT  THERE WERE RUMBLINGS AND MUTTERINGS IN THE LABOR WORLD  NEXT  THEFAVORED UNIONS WITHDREW FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND BROKEOFF ALL AFFILIATIONS  THEN CAME TROUBLE AND VIOLENCE  THE MEMBERS OF THEFAVORED UNIONS WERE BRANDED AS TRAITORS  AND IN SALOONS AND BROTHELS  ONTHE STREETS AND AT WORK  AND  IN FACT  EVERYWHERE  THEY WERE ASSAULTEDBY THE COMRADES THEY HAD SO TREACHEROUSLY DESERTED COUNTLESS HEADS WERE BROKEN  AND THERE WERE MANY KILLED  NO MEMBER OFTHE FAVORED UNIONS WAS SAFE  THEY GATHERED TOGETHER IN BANDS IN ORDER TOGO TO WORK OR TO RETURN FROM WORK  THEY WALKED ALWAYS IN THE MIDDLEOF THE STREET  ON THE SIDEWALK THEY WERE LIABLE TO HAVE THEIR SKULLSCRUSHED BY BRICKS AND COBBLESTONES THROWN FROM WINDOWS AND HOUSE TOPS THEY WERE PERMITTED TO CARRY WEAPONS  AND THE AUTHORITIES AIDED THEMIN EVERY WAY  THEIR PERSECUTORS WERE SENTENCED TO LONG TERMS IN PRISON WHERE THEY WERE HARSHLY TREATED  WHILE NO MAN  NOT A MEMBER OF THEFAVORED UNIONS  WAS PERMITTED TO CARRY WEAPONS  VIOLATION OF THIS LAWWAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY OUTRAGED LABOR CONTINUED TO WREAK VENGEANCE ON THE TRAITORS  CASTE LINESFORMED AUTOMATICALLY  THE CHILDREN OF THE TRAITORS WERE PERSECUTEDBY THE CHILDREN OF THE WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN BETRAYED  UNTIL IT WASIMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FORMER TO PLAY ON THE STREETS OR TO ATTEND THE PUBLICSCHOOLS  ALSO  THE WIVES AND FAMILIES OF THE TRAITORS WERE OSTRACIZED WHILE THE CORNER GROCERYMAN WHO SOLD PROVISIONS TO THEM WAS BOYCOTTED AS A RESULT  DRIVEN BACK UPON THEMSELVES FROM EVERY SIDE  THE TRAITORSAND THEIR FAMILIES BECAME CLANNISH  FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DWELL INSAFETY IN THE MIDST OF THE BETRAYED PROLETARIAT  THEY MOVED INTO NEWLOCALITIES INHABITED BY THEMSELVES ALONE  IN THIS THEY WERE FAVORED BYTHE OLIGARCHS  GOOD DWELLINGS  MODERN AND SANITARY  WERE BUILT FOR THEM SURROUNDED BY SPACIOUS YARDS  AND SEPARATED HERE AND THERE BY PARKS ANDPLAYGROUNDS  THEIR CHILDREN ATTENDED SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY BUILT FORTHEM  AND IN THESE SCHOOLS MANUAL TRAINING AND APPLIED SCIENCE WERESPECIALIZED UPON  THUS  AND UNAVOIDABLY  AT THE VERY BEGINNING  OUT OFTHIS SEGREGATION AROSE CASTE  THE MEMBERS OF THE FAVORED UNIONS BECAMETHE ARISTOCRACY OF LABOR  THEY WERE SET APART FROM THE REST OF LABOR THEY WERE BETTER HOUSED  BETTER CLOTHED  BETTER FED  BETTER TREATED THEY WERE GRAB SHARING WITH A VENGEANCE IN THE MEANTIME  THE REST OF THE WORKING CLASS WAS MORE HARSHLY TREATED MANY LITTLE PRIVILEGES WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM IT  WHILE ITS WAGES AND ITSSTANDARD OF LIVING STEADILY SANK DOWN  INCIDENTALLY  ITS PUBLIC SCHOOLSDETERIORATED  AND EDUCATION SLOWLY CEASED TO BE COMPULSORY  THE INCREASEIN THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT READ NOR WRITE WASPERILOUS THE CAPTURE OF THE WORLD MARKET BY THE UNITED STATES HAD DISRUPTED THEREST OF THE WORLD  INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTS WERE EVERYWHERE CRASHINGOR TRANSFORMING  GERMANY  ITALY  FRANCE  AUSTRALIA  AND NEW ZEALAND WEREBUSY FORMING COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTHS  THE BRITISH EMPIRE WAS FALLINGAPART  ENGLAND S HANDS WERE FULL  IN INDIA REVOLT WAS IN FULL SWING  THECRY IN ALL ASIA WAS   ASIA FOR THE ASIATICS   AND BEHIND THIS CRY WASJAPAN  EVER URGING AND AIDING THE YELLOW AND BROWN RACES AGAINST THEWHITE  AND WHILE JAPAN DREAMED OF CONTINENTAL EMPIRE AND STROVE TOREALIZE THE DREAM  SHE SUPPRESSED HER OWN PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION  ITWAS A SIMPLE WAR OF THE CASTES  COOLIE VERSUS SAMURAI  AND THE COOLIESOCIALISTS WERE EXECUTED BY TENS OF THOUSANDS  FORTY THOUSAND WEREKILLED IN THE STREET FIGHTING OF TOKIO AND IN THE FUTILE ASSAULT ONTHE MIKADO S PALACE  KOBE WAS A SHAMBLES  THE SLAUGHTER OF THE COTTONOPERATIVES BY MACHINE GUNS BECAME CLASSIC AS THE MOST TERRIFIC EXECUTIONEVER ACHIEVED BY MODERN WAR MACHINES  MOST SAVAGE OF ALL WAS THEJAPANESE OLIGARCHY THAT AROSE  JAPAN DOMINATED THE EAST  AND TOOKTO HERSELF THE WHOLE ASIATIC PORTION OF THE WORLD MARKET  WITH THEEXCEPTION OF INDIA ENGLAND MANAGED TO CRUSH HER OWN PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION AND TO HOLD ONTO INDIA  THOUGH SHE WAS BROUGHT TO THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION  ALSO  SHEWAS COMPELLED TO LET HER GREAT COLONIES SLIP AWAY FROM HER  SO IT WASTHAT THE SOCIALISTS SUCCEEDED IN MAKING AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND INTOCOOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTHS  AND IT WAS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT CANADAWAS LOST TO THE MOTHER COUNTRY  BUT CANADA CRUSHED HER OWN SOCIALISTREVOLUTION  BEING AIDED IN THIS BY THE IRON HEEL  AT THE SAME TIME  THEIRON HEEL HELPED MEXICO AND CUBA TO PUT DOWN REVOLT  THE RESULT WAS THATTHE IRON HEEL WAS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN THE NEW WORLD  IT HAD WELDEDINTO ONE COMPACT POLITICAL MASS THE WHOLE OF NORTH AMERICA FROM THEPANAMA CANAL TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN AND ENGLAND  AT THE SACRIFICE OF HER GREAT COLONIES  HAD SUCCEEDED ONLYIN RETAINING INDIA  BUT THIS WAS NO MORE THAN TEMPORARY  THE STRUGGLEWITH JAPAN AND THE REST OF ASIA FOR INDIA WAS MERELY DELAYED  ENGLANDWAS DESTINED SHORTLY TO LOSE INDIA  WHILE BEHIND THAT EVENT LOOMED THESTRUGGLE BETWEEN A UNITED ASIA AND THE WORLD AND WHILE ALL THE WORLD WAS TORN WITH CONFLICT  WE OF THE UNITED STATESWERE NOT PLACID AND PEACEFUL  THE DEFECTION OF THE GREAT UNIONS HADPREVENTED OUR PROLETARIAN REVOLT  BUT VIOLENCE WAS EVERYWHERE  INADDITION TO THE LABOR TROUBLES  AND THE DISCONTENT OF THE FARMERS AND OFTHE REMNANT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS  A RELIGIOUS REVIVAL HAD BLAZED UP  ANOFFSHOOT OF THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS SPRANG INTO SUDDEN PROMINENCE PROCLAIMING THE END OF THE WORLD  CONFUSION THRICE CONFOUNDED   ERNEST CRIED   HOW CAN WE HOPE FORSOLIDARITY WITH ALL THESE CROSS PURPOSES AND CONFLICTS  AND TRULY THE RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ASSUMED FORMIDABLE PROPORTIONS  THEPEOPLE  WHAT OF THEIR WRETCHEDNESS  AND OF THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT INALL THINGS EARTHLY  WERE RIPE AND EAGER FOR A HEAVEN WHERE INDUSTRIALTYRANTS ENTERED NO MORE THAN CAMELS PASSED THROUGH NEEDLE EYES WILD EYED ITINERANT PREACHERS SWARMED OVER THE LAND  AND DESPITETHE PROHIBITION OF THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES  AND THE PERSECUTION FORDISOBEDIENCE  THE FLAMES OF RELIGIOUS FRENZY WERE FANNED BY COUNTLESSCAMP MEETINGS IT WAS THE LAST DAYS  THEY CLAIMED  THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THEWORLD  THE FOUR WINDS HAD BEEN LOOSED  GOD HAD STIRRED THE NATIONSTO STRIFE  IT WAS A TIME OF VISIONS AND MIRACLES  WHILE SEERS ANDPROPHETESSES WERE LEGION  THE PEOPLE CEASED WORK BY HUNDREDS OFTHOUSANDS AND FLED TO THE MOUNTAINS  THERE TO AWAIT THE IMMINENT COMINGOF GOD AND THE RISING OF THE HUNDRED AND FORTY AND FOUR THOUSAND TOHEAVEN  BUT IN THE MEANTIME GOD DID NOT COME  AND THEY STARVED TO DEATHIN GREAT NUMBERS  IN THEIR DESPERATION THEY RAVAGED THE FARMS FOR FOOD AND THE CONSEQUENT TUMULT AND ANARCHY IN THE COUNTRY DISTRICTS BUTINCREASED THE WOES OF THE POOR EXPROPRIATED FARMERS ALSO  THE FARMS AND WAREHOUSES WERE THE PROPERTY OF THE IRON HEEL ARMIES OF TROOPS WERE PUT INTO THE FIELD  AND THE FANATICS WERE HERDEDBACK AT THE BAYONET POINT TO THEIR TASKS IN THE CITIES  THERE THEY BROKEOUT IN EVER RECURRING MOBS AND RIOTS  THEIR LEADERS WERE EXECUTED FORSEDITION OR CONFINED IN MADHOUSES  THOSE WHO WERE EXECUTED WENT TO THEIRDEATHS WITH ALL THE GLADNESS OF MARTYRS  IT WAS A TIME OF MADNESS  THEUNREST SPREAD  IN THE SWAMPS AND DESERTS AND WASTE PLACES  FROM FLORIDATO ALASKA  THE SMALL GROUPS OF INDIANS THAT SURVIVED WERE DANCING GHOSTDANCES AND WAITING THE COMING OF A MESSIAH OF THEIR OWN AND THROUGH IT ALL  WITH A SERENITY AND CERTITUDE THAT WAS TERRIFYING CONTINUED TO RISE THE FORM OF THAT MONSTER OF THE AGES  THE OLIGARCHY WITH IRON HAND AND IRON HEEL IT MASTERED THE SURGING MILLIONS  OUTOF CONFUSION BROUGHT ORDER  OUT OF THE VERY CHAOS WROUGHT ITS OWNFOUNDATION AND STRUCTURE  JUST WAIT TILL WE GET IN   THE GRANGERS SAID  CALVIN SAID IT TO US INOUR PELL STREET QUARTERS   LOOK AT THE STATES WE VE CAPTURED  WITH YOUSOCIALISTS TO BACK US  WE LL MAKE THEM SING ANOTHER SONG WHEN WE TAKEOFFICE   THE MILLIONS OF THE DISCONTENTED AND THE IMPOVERISHED ARE OURS   THESOCIALISTS SAID   THE GRANGERS HAVE COME OVER TO US  THE FARMERS  THEMIDDLE CLASS  AND THE LABORERS  THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM WILL FALL TOPIECES  IN ANOTHER MONTH WE SEND FIFTY MEN TO CONGRESS  TWO YEARSHENCE EVERY OFFICE WILL BE OURS  FROM THE PRESIDENT DOWN TO THE LOCALDOG CATCHER  TO ALL OF WHICH ERNEST WOULD SHAKE HIS HEAD AND SAY  HOW MANY RIFLES HAVE YOU GOT  DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET PLENTYOF LEAD  WHEN IT COMES TO POWDER  CHEMICAL MIXTURES ARE BETTER THANMECHANICAL MIXTURES  YOU TAKE MY WORD  CHAPTER XVITHE ENDWHEN IT CAME TIME FOR ERNEST AND ME TO GO TO WASHINGTON  FATHER DID NOTACCOMPANY US  HE HAD BECOME ENAMOURED OF PROLETARIAN LIFE  HE LOOKEDUPON OUR SLUM NEIGHBORHOOD AS A GREAT SOCIOLOGICAL LABORATORY  ANDHE HAD EMBARKED UPON AN APPARENTLY ENDLESS ORGY OF INVESTIGATION  HECHUMMED WITH THE LABORERS  AND WAS AN INTIMATE IN SCORES OF HOMES ALSO  HE WORKED AT ODD JOBS  AND THE WORK WAS PLAY AS WELL AS LEARNEDINVESTIGATION  FOR HE DELIGHTED IN IT AND WAS ALWAYS RETURNING HOME WITHCOPIOUS NOTES AND BUBBLING OVER WITH NEW ADVENTURES  HE WAS THE PERFECTSCIENTIST THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIS WORKING AT ALL  BECAUSE ERNEST MANAGED TO EARNENOUGH FROM HIS TRANSLATING TO TAKE CARE OF THE THREE OF US  BUT FATHERINSISTED ON PURSUING HIS FAVORITE PHANTOM  AND A PROTEAN PHANTOM IT WAS JUDGING FROM THE JOBS HE WORKED AT  I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE EVENING HEBROUGHT HOME HIS STREET PEDLER S OUTFIT OF SHOE LACES AND SUSPENDERS NOR THE TIME I WENT INTO THE LITTLE CORNER GROCERY TO MAKE SOME PURCHASEAND HAD HIM WAIT ON ME  AFTER THAT I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN HE TENDEDBAR FOR A WEEK IN THE SALOON ACROSS THE STREET  HE WORKED AS A NIGHTWATCHMAN  HAWKED POTATOES ON THE STREET  PASTED LABELS IN A CANNERYWAREHOUSE  WAS UTILITY MAN IN A PAPER BOX FACTORY  AND WATER CARRIERFOR A STREET RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION GANG  AND EVEN JOINED THE DISHWASHERS UNION JUST BEFORE IT FELL TO PIECES I THINK THE BISHOP S EXAMPLE  SO FAR AS WEARING APPAREL WAS CONCERNED MUST HAVE FASCINATED FATHER  FOR HE WORE THE CHEAP COTTON SHIRT OF THELABORER AND THE OVERALLS WITH THE NARROW STRAP ABOUT THE HIPS  YET ONEHABIT REMAINED TO HIM FROM THE OLD LIFE  HE ALWAYS DRESSED FOR DINNER OR SUPPER  RATHER I COULD BE HAPPY ANYWHERE WITH ERNEST  AND FATHER S HAPPINESS IN OURCHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES ROUNDED OUT MY OWN HAPPINESS  WHEN I WAS A BOY   FATHER SAID   I WAS VERY CURIOUS  I WANTED TO KNOWWHY THINGS WERE AND HOW THEY CAME TO PASS  THAT WAS WHY I BECAME APHYSICIST  THE LIFE IN ME TO DAY IS JUST AS CURIOUS AS IT WAS IN MYBOYHOOD  AND IT S THE BEING CURIOUS THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING  SOMETIMES HE VENTURED NORTH OF MARKET STREET INTO THE SHOPPING ANDTHEATRE DISTRICT  WHERE HE SOLD PAPERS  RAN ERRANDS  AND OPENED CABS THERE  ONE DAY  CLOSING A CAB  HE ENCOUNTERED MR  WICKSON  IN HIGH GLEEFATHER DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT TO US THAT EVENING  WICKSON LOOKED AT ME SHARPLY WHEN I CLOSED THE DOOR ON HIM  ANDMUTTERED   WELL  I LL BE DAMNED   JUST LIKE THAT HE SAID IT   WELL  I LLBE DAMNED   HIS FACE TURNED RED AND HE WAS SO CONFUSED THAT HE FORGOT TOTIP ME  BUT HE MUST HAVE RECOVERED HIMSELF QUICKLY  FOR THE CAB HADN TGONE FIFTY FEET BEFORE IT TURNED AROUND AND CAME BACK  HE LEANED OUT OFTHE DOOR   LOOK HERE  PROFESSOR   HE SAID   THIS IS TOO MUCH  WHAT CAN I DO FORYOU    I CLOSED THE CAB DOOR FOR YOU   I ANSWERED   ACCORDING TO COMMONCUSTOM YOU MIGHT GIVE ME A DIME    BOTHER THAT   HE SNORTED   I MEAN SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL   HE WAS CERTAINLY SERIOUS  A TWINGE OF OSSIFIED CONSCIENCE OR SOMETHING AND SO I CONSIDERED WITH GRAVE DELIBERATION FOR A MOMENT  HIS FACE WAS QUITE EXPECTANT WHEN I BEGAN MY ANSWER  BUT YOU SHOULDHAVE SEEN IT WHEN I FINISHED   YOU MIGHT GIVE ME BACK MY HOME   I SAID   AND MY STOCK IN THE SIERRAMILLS   FATHER PAUSED  WHAT DID HE SAY   I QUESTIONED EAGERLY  WHAT COULD HE SAY  HE SAID NOTHING  BUT I SAID   I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY  HE LOOKED AT ME CURIOUSLY   TELL ME  ARE YOU HAPPY    I ASKED  HE ORDERED THE CABMAN TO DRIVE ON  AND WENT AWAY SWEARING HORRIBLY  ANDHE DIDN T GIVE ME THE DIME  MUCH LESS THE HOME AND STOCK  SO YOU SEE  MYDEAR  YOUR FATHER S STREET ARAB CAREER IS BESET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS  AND SO IT WAS THAT FATHER KEPT ON AT OUR PELL STREET QUARTERS  WHILEERNEST AND I WENT TO WASHINGTON  EXCEPT FOR THE FINAL CONSUMMATION  THEOLD ORDER HAD PASSED AWAY  AND THE FINAL CONSUMMATION WAS NEARER THANI DREAMED  CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATION  NO OBSTACLES WERE RAISED TOPREVENT THE SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN FROM TAKING THEIR SEATS  EVERYTHINGWENT SMOOTHLY  AND I LAUGHED AT ERNEST WHEN HE LOOKED UPON THE VERYSMOOTHNESS AS SOMETHING OMINOUS WE FOUND OUR SOCIALIST COMRADES CONFIDENT  OPTIMISTIC OF THEIR STRENGTHAND OF THE THINGS THEY WOULD ACCOMPLISH  A FEW GRANGERS WHO HAD BEENELECTED TO CONGRESS INCREASED OUR STRENGTH  AND AN ELABORATE PROGRAMMEOF WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WAS PREPARED BY THE UNITED FORCES  IN ALL OFWHICH ERNEST JOINED LOYALLY AND ENERGETICALLY  THOUGH HE COULD NOTFORBEAR  NOW AND AGAIN  FROM SAYING  APROPOS OF NOTHING IN PARTICULAR  WHEN IT COMES TO POWDER  CHEMICAL MIXTURES ARE BETTER THAN MECHANICALMIXTURES  YOU TAKE MY WORD  THE TROUBLE AROSE FIRST WITH THE GRANGERS IN THE VARIOUS STATES THEY HADCAPTURED AT THE LAST ELECTION  THERE WERE A DOZEN OF THESE STATES  BUTTHE GRANGERS WHO HAD BEEN ELECTED WERE NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE OFFICE  THEINCUMBENTS REFUSED TO GET OUT  IT WAS VERY SIMPLE  THEY MERELY CHARGEDILLEGALITY IN THE ELECTIONS AND WRAPPED UP THE WHOLE SITUATION IN THEINTERMINABLE RED TAPE OF THE LAW  THE GRANGERS WERE POWERLESS  THECOURTS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THEIR ENEMIES THIS WAS THE MOMENT OF DANGER  IF THE CHEATED GRANGERS BECAME VIOLENT ALL WAS LOST  HOW WE SOCIALISTS WORKED TO HOLD THEM BACK  THERE WEREDAYS AND NIGHTS WHEN ERNEST NEVER CLOSED HIS EYES IN SLEEP  THE BIGLEADERS OF THE GRANGERS SAW THE PERIL AND WERE WITH US TO A MAN  BUTIT WAS ALL OF NO AVAIL  THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE  AND IT SETITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK  WITHOUT DISCUSSION  IT WAS THEAGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT IN A DOZEN STATES THE REVOLT FLARED UP  THE EXPROPRIATED FARMERSTOOK FORCIBLE POSSESSION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS  OF COURSE THIS WASUNCONSTITUTIONAL  AND OF COURSE THE UNITED STATES PUT ITS SOLDIERS INTOTHE FIELD  EVERYWHERE THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS URGED THE PEOPLE ON  THESEEMISSARIES OF THE IRON HEEL DISGUISED THEMSELVES AS ARTISANS  FARMERS AND FARM LABORERS  IN SACRAMENTO  THE CAPITAL OF CALIFORNIA  THEGRANGERS HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAINTAINING ORDER  THOUSANDS OF SECRET AGENTSWERE RUSHED TO THE DEVOTED CITY  IN MOBS COMPOSED WHOLLY OF THEMSELVES THEY FIRED AND LOOTED BUILDINGS AND FACTORIES  THEY WORKED THE PEOPLEUP UNTIL THEY JOINED THEM IN THE PILLAGE  LIQUOR IN LARGE QUANTITIES WASDISTRIBUTED AMONG THE SLUM CLASSES FURTHER TO INFLAME THEIR MINDS  ANDTHEN  WHEN ALL WAS READY  APPEARED UPON THE SCENE THE SOLDIERS OF THEUNITED STATES  WHO WERE  IN REALITY  THE SOLDIERS OF THE IRON HEEL ELEVEN THOUSAND MEN  WOMEN  AND CHILDREN WERE SHOT DOWN ON THE STREETSOF SACRAMENTO OR MURDERED IN THEIR HOUSES  THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TOOKPOSSESSION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT  AND ALL WAS OVER FOR CALIFORNIA AND AS WITH CALIFORNIA  SO ELSEWHERE  EVERY GRANGER STATE WAS RAVAGEDWITH VIOLENCE AND WASHED IN BLOOD  FIRST  DISORDER WAS PRECIPITATED BYTHE SECRET AGENTS AND THE BLACK HUNDREDS  THEN THE TROOPS WERE CALLEDOUT  RIOTING AND MOB RULE REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE RURAL DISTRICTS  DAYAND NIGHT THE SMOKE OF BURNING FARMS  WAREHOUSES  VILLAGES  AND CITIESFILLED THE SKY  DYNAMITE APPEARED  RAILROAD BRIDGES AND TUNNELS WEREBLOWN UP AND TRAINS WERE WRECKED  THE POOR FARMERS WERE SHOT AND HANGEDIN GREAT NUMBERS  REPRISALS WERE BITTER  AND MANY PLUTOCRATS AND ARMYOFFICERS WERE MURDERED  BLOOD AND VENGEANCE WERE IN MEN S HEARTS  THEREGULAR TROOPS FOUGHT THE FARMERS AS SAVAGELY AS HAD THEY BEEN INDIANS AND THE REGULAR TROOPS HAD CAUSE  TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM HAD BEENANNIHILATED IN A TREMENDOUS SERIES OF DYNAMITE EXPLOSIONS IN OREGON AND IN A SIMILAR MANNER  A NUMBER OF TRAIN LOADS  AT DIFFERENT TIMES ANDPLACES  HAD BEEN DESTROYED  SO IT WAS THAT THE REGULAR TROOPS FOUGHT FORTHEIR LIVES AS WELL AS DID THE FARMERS AS FOR THE MILITIA  THE MILITIA LAW OF      WAS PUT INTO EFFECT  AND THEWORKERS OF ONE STATE WERE COMPELLED  UNDER PAIN OF DEATH  TO SHOOT DOWNTHEIR COMRADE WORKERS IN OTHER STATES  OF COURSE  THE MILITIA LAW DIDNOT WORK SMOOTHLY AT FIRST  MANY MILITIA OFFICERS WERE MURDERED  ANDMANY MILITIAMEN WERE EXECUTED BY DRUMHEAD COURT MARTIAL  ERNEST SPROPHECY WAS STRIKINGLY FULFILLED IN THE CASES OF MR  KOWALT AND MR ASMUNSEN  BOTH WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE MILITIA  AND BOTH WERE DRAFTED TOSERVE IN THE PUNITIVE EXPEDITION THAT WAS DESPATCHED FROM CALIFORNIAAGAINST THE FARMERS OF MISSOURI  MR  KOWALT AND MR  ASMUNSEN REFUSED TOSERVE  THEY WERE GIVEN SHORT SHRIFT  DRUMHEAD COURT MARTIAL WAS THEIRPORTION  AND MILITARY EXECUTION THEIR END  THEY WERE SHOT WITH THEIRBACKS TO THE FIRING SQUAD MANY YOUNG MEN FLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO ESCAPE SERVING IN THE MILITIA THERE THEY BECAME OUTLAWS  AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL MORE PEACEFUL TIMES THATTHEY RECEIVED THEIR PUNISHMENT  IT WAS DRASTIC  THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED APROCLAMATION FOR ALL LAW ABIDING CITIZENS TO COME IN FROM THE MOUNTAINSFOR A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS  WHEN THE PROCLAIMED DATE ARRIVED  HALF AMILLION SOLDIERS WERE SENT INTO THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICTS EVERYWHERE THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION  NO TRIAL  WHEREVER A MAN WAS ENCOUNTERED  HEWAS SHOT DOWN ON THE SPOT  THE TROOPS OPERATED ON THE BASIS THAT NOMAN NOT AN OUTLAW REMAINED IN THE MOUNTAINS  SOME BANDS  IN STRONGPOSITIONS  FOUGHT GALLANTLY  BUT IN THE END EVERY DESERTER FROM THEMILITIA MET DEATH A MORE IMMEDIATE LESSON  HOWEVER  WAS IMPRESSED ON THE MINDS OF THEPEOPLE BY THE PUNISHMENT METED OUT TO THE KANSAS MILITIA  THE GREATKANSAS MUTINY OCCURRED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF MILITARY OPERATIONSAGAINST THE GRANGERS  SIX THOUSAND OF THE MILITIA MUTINIED  THEY HADBEEN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS VERY TURBULENT AND SULLEN  AND FOR THAT REASONHAD BEEN KEPT IN CAMP  THEIR OPEN MUTINY  HOWEVER  WAS WITHOUT DOUBTPRECIPITATED BY THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS ON THE NIGHT OF THE   D OF APRIL THEY AROSE AND MURDERED THEIR OFFICERS ONLY A SMALL REMNANT OF THE LATTER ESCAPING  THIS WAS BEYOND THE SCHEMEOF THE IRON HEEL  FOR THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS HAD DONE THEIR WORK TOOWELL  BUT EVERYTHING WAS GRIST TO THE IRON HEEL  IT HAD PREPARED FOR THEOUTBREAK  AND THE KILLING OF SO MANY OFFICERS GAVE IT JUSTIFICATION FORWHAT FOLLOWED  AS BY MAGIC  FORTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS OF THE REGULAR ARMYSURROUNDED THE MALCONTENTS  IT WAS A TRAP  THE WRETCHED MILITIAMEN FOUNDTHAT THEIR MACHINE GUNS HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH  AND THAT THE CARTRIDGESFROM THE CAPTURED MAGAZINES DID NOT FIT THEIR RIFLES  THEY HOISTED THEWHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER  BUT IT WAS IGNORED  THERE WERE NO SURVIVORS THE ENTIRE SIX THOUSAND WERE ANNIHILATED  COMMON SHELL AND SHRAPNEL WERETHROWN IN UPON THEM FROM A DISTANCE  AND  WHEN  IN THEIR DESPERATION THEY CHARGED THE ENCIRCLING LINES  THEY WERE MOWED DOWN BY THEMACHINE GUNS  I TALKED WITH AN EYE WITNESS  AND HE SAID THAT THE NEARESTANY MILITIAMAN APPROACHED THE MACHINE GUNS WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTYYARDS  THE EARTH WAS CARPETED WITH THE SLAIN  AND A FINAL CHARGE OFCAVALRY  WITH TRAMPLING OF HORSES  HOOFS  REVOLVERS  AND SABRES  CRUSHEDTHE WOUNDED INTO THE GROUND SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE GRANGERS CAME THE REVOLTOF THE COAL MINERS  IT WAS THE EXPIRING EFFORT OF ORGANIZED LABOR THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION OF MINERS WENT OUT ON STRIKE  BUT THEYWERE TOO WIDELY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY TO ADVANTAGE FROM THEIR OWNSTRENGTH  THEY WERE SEGREGATED IN THEIR OWN DISTRICTS AND BEATEN INTOSUBMISSION  THIS WAS THE FIRST GREAT SLAVE DRIVE  POCOCK  WON HIS SPURSAS A SLAVE DRIVER AND EARNED THE UNDYING HATRED OF THE PROLETARIAT COUNTLESS ATTEMPTS WERE MADE UPON HIS LIFE  BUT HE SEEMED TO BEAR ACHARMED EXISTENCE  IT WAS HE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTRODUCTIONOF THE RUSSIAN PASSPORT SYSTEM AMONG THE MINERS  AND THE DENIAL OF THEIRRIGHT OF REMOVAL FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER        ALBERT POCOCK  ANOTHER OF THE NOTORIOUS STRIKE BREAKERS OF     EARLIER YEARS  WHO  TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH  SUCCESSFULLY     HELD ALL THE COAL MINERS OF THE COUNTRY TO THEIR TASK   HE     WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON  LEWIS POCOCK  AND FOR FIVE     GENERATIONS THIS REMARKABLE LINE OF SLAVE DRIVERS HANDLED     THE COAL MINES   THE ELDER POCOCK  KNOWN AS POCOCK I   HAS     BEEN DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS   A LONG  LEAN HEAD  SEMICIRCLED     BY A FRINGE OF BROWN AND GRAY HAIR  WITH BIG CHEEK BONES AND     A HEAVY CHIN        A PALE FACE  LUSTRELESS GRAY EYES  A     METALLIC VOICE  AND A LANGUID MANNER    HE WAS BORN OF     HUMBLE PARENTS  AND BEGAN HIS CAREER AS A BARTENDER   HE     NEXT BECAME A PRIVATE DETECTIVE FOR A STREET RAILWAY     CORPORATION  AND BY SUCCESSIVE STEPS DEVELOPED INTO A     PROFESSIONAL STRIKEBREAKER  POCOCK V   THE LAST OF THE LINE      WAS BLOWN UP IN A PUMP HOUSE BY A BOMB DURING A PETTY REVOLT     OF THE MINERS IN THE INDIAN TERRITORY  THIS OCCURRED IN          A D IN THE MEANTIME  THE SOCIALISTS HELD FIRM  WHILE THE GRANGERS EXPIRED INFLAME AND BLOOD  AND ORGANIZED LABOR WAS DISRUPTED  THE SOCIALISTSHELD THEIR PEACE AND PERFECTED THEIR SECRET ORGANIZATION  IN VAIN THEGRANGERS PLEADED WITH US  WE RIGHTLY CONTENDED THAT ANY REVOLT ON OURPART WAS VIRTUALLY SUICIDE FOR THE WHOLE REVOLUTION  THE IRON HEEL  ATFIRST DUBIOUS ABOUT DEALING WITH THE ENTIRE PROLETARIAT AT ONE TIME  HADFOUND THE WORK EASIER THAN IT HAD EXPECTED  AND WOULD HAVE ASKED NOTHINGBETTER THAN AN UPRISING ON OUR PART  BUT WE AVOIDED THE ISSUE  IN SPITEOF THE FACT THAT AGENTS PROVOCATEURS SWARMED IN OUR MIDST  IN THOSEEARLY DAYS  THE AGENTS OF THE IRON HEEL WERE CLUMSY IN THEIR METHODS THEY HAD MUCH TO LEARN AND IN THE MEANTIME OUR FIGHTING GROUPS WEEDEDTHEM OUT  IT WAS BITTER  BLOODY WORK  BUT WE WERE FIGHTING FOR LIFE ANDFOR THE REVOLUTION  AND WE HAD TO FIGHT THE ENEMY WITH ITS OWN WEAPONS YET WE WERE FAIR  NO AGENT OF THE IRON HEEL WAS EXECUTED WITHOUT ATRIAL  WE MAY HAVE MADE MISTAKES  BUT IF SO  VERY RARELY  THE BRAVEST AND THE MOST COMBATIVE AND SELF SACRIFICING OF OUR COMRADES WENT INTOTHE FIGHTING GROUPS  ONCE  AFTER TEN YEARS HAD PASSED  ERNEST MADE ACALCULATION FROM FIGURES FURNISHED BY THE CHIEFS OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS AND HIS CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE AVERAGE LIFE OF A MAN OR WOMAN AFTERBECOMING A MEMBER WAS FIVE YEARS  THE COMRADES OF THE FIGHTING GROUPSWERE HEROES ALL  AND THE PECULIAR THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THEY WEREOPPOSED TO THE TAKING OF LIFE  THEY VIOLATED THEIR OWN NATURES  YET THEYLOVED LIBERTY AND KNEW OF NO SACRIFICE TOO GREAT TO MAKE FOR THE CAUSE         THESE FIGHTING GROUPS WERE MODELLED SOMEWHAT AFTER THE     FIGHTING ORGANIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION  AND      DESPITE THE UNCEASING EFFORTS OF THE IRON HEEL  THESE GROUPS     PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE THREE CENTURIES OF ITS EXISTENCE      COMPOSED OF MEN AND WOMEN ACTUATED BY LOFTY PURPOSE AND     UNAFRAID TO DIE  THE FIGHTING GROUPS EXERCISED TREMENDOUS     INFLUENCE AND TEMPERED THE SAVAGE BRUTALITY OF THE RULERS      NOT ALONE WAS THEIR WORK CONFINED TO UNSEEN WARFARE WITH THE     SECRET AGENTS OF THE OLIGARCHY   THE OLIGARCHS THEMSELVES     WERE COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO THE DECREES OF THE GROUPS  AND     OFTEN  WHEN THEY DISOBEYED  WERE PUNISHED BY DEATH  AND     LIKEWISE WITH THE SUBORDINATES OF THE OLIGARCHS  WITH THE     OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND THE LEADERS OF THE LABOR CASTES      STERN JUSTICE WAS METED OUT BY THESE ORGANIZED AVENGERS  BUT     MOST REMARKABLE WAS THEIR PASSIONLESS AND JUDICIAL     PROCEDURE   THERE WERE NO SNAP JUDGMENTS   WHEN A MAN WAS     CAPTURED HE WAS GIVEN FAIR TRIAL AND OPPORTUNITY FOR     DEFENCE   OF NECESSITY  MANY MEN WERE TRIED AND CONDEMNED BY     PROXY  AS IN THE CASE OF GENERAL LAMPTON  THIS OCCURRED IN          A D   POSSIBLY THE MOST BLOODTHIRSTY AND MALIGNANT OF     ALL THE MERCENARIES THAT EVER SERVED THE IRON HEEL  HE WAS     INFORMED BY THE FIGHTING GROUPS THAT THEY HAD TRIED HIM      FOUND HIM GUILTY  AND CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH  AND THIS      AFTER THREE WARNINGS FOR HIM TO CEASE FROM HIS FEROCIOUS     TREATMENT OF THE PROLETARIAT   AFTER HIS CONDEMNATION HE     SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH A MYRIAD PROTECTIVE DEVICES   YEARS     PASSED  AND IN VAIN THE FIGHTING GROUPS STROVE TO EXECUTE     THEIR DECREE   COMRADE AFTER COMRADE  MEN AND WOMEN  FAILED     IN THEIR ATTEMPTS  AND WERE CRUELLY EXECUTED BY THE     OLIGARCHY   IT WAS THE CASE OF GENERAL LAMPTON THAT REVIVED     CRUCIFIXION AS A LEGAL METHOD OF EXECUTION   BUT IN THE END     THE CONDEMNED MAN FOUND HIS EXECUTIONER IN THE FORM OF A     SLENDER GIRL OF SEVENTEEN  MADELINE PROVENCE  WHO  TO     ACCOMPLISH HER PURPOSE  SERVED TWO YEARS IN HIS PALACE AS A     SEAMSTRESS TO THE HOUSEHOLD  SHE DIED IN SOLITARY     CONFINEMENT AFTER HORRIBLE AND PROLONGED TORTURE  BUT TO DAY     SHE STANDS IN IMPERISHABLE BRONZE IN THE PANTHEON OF     BROTHERHOOD IN THE WONDER CITY OF SERLES      WE  WHO BY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE KNOW NOTHING OF BLOODSHED      MUST NOT JUDGE HARSHLY THE HEROES OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS      THEY GAVE UP THEIR LIVES FOR HUMANITY  NO SACRIFICE WAS TOO     GREAT FOR THEM TO ACCOMPLISH  WHILE INEXORABLE NECESSITY     COMPELLED THEM TO BLOODY EXPRESSION IN AN AGE OF BLOOD   THE     FIGHTING GROUPS CONSTITUTED THE ONE THORN IN THE SIDE OF THE     IRON HEEL THAT THE IRON HEEL COULD NEVER REMOVE   EVERHARD     WAS THE FATHER OF THIS CURIOUS ARMY  AND ITS ACCOMPLISHMENTS     AND SUCCESSFUL PERSISTENCE FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEAR     WITNESS TO THE WISDOM WITH WHICH HE ORGANIZED AND THE SOLID     FOUNDATION HE LAID FOR THE SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS TO BUILD     UPON   IN SOME RESPECTS  DESPITE HIS GREAT ECONOMIC AND     SOCIOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS  AND HIS WORK AS A GENERAL LEADER     IN THE REVOLUTION  HIS ORGANIZATION OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS     MUST BE REGARDED AS HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD  FIRST  THE WEEDING OUT FROM OURCIRCLES OF THE SECRET AGENTS OF THE OLIGARCHY  SECOND  THE ORGANIZINGOF THE FIGHTING GROUPS  AND OUTSIDE OF THEM  OF THE GENERAL SECRETORGANIZATION OF THE REVOLUTION  AND THIRD  THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR OWNSECRET AGENTS INTO EVERY BRANCH OF THE OLIGARCHY  INTO THE LABOR CASTESAND ESPECIALLY AMONG THE TELEGRAPHERS AND SECRETARIES AND CLERKS  INTOTHE ARMY  THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS  AND THE SLAVE DRIVERS  IT WAS SLOWWORK  AND PERILOUS  AND OFTEN WERE OUR EFFORTS REWARDED WITH COSTLYFAILURES THE IRON HEEL HAD TRIUMPHED IN OPEN WARFARE  BUT WE HELD OUR OWN IN THENEW WARFARE  STRANGE AND AWFUL AND SUBTERRANEAN  THAT WE INSTITUTED ALL WAS UNSEEN  MUCH WAS UNGUESSED  THE BLIND FOUGHT THE BLIND  ANDYET THROUGH IT ALL WAS ORDER  PURPOSE  CONTROL  WE PERMEATED THEENTIRE ORGANIZATION OF THE IRON HEEL WITH OUR AGENTS  WHILE OUR OWNORGANIZATION WAS PERMEATED WITH THE AGENTS OF THE IRON HEEL  IT WASWARFARE DARK AND DEVIOUS  REPLETE WITH INTRIGUE AND CONSPIRACY  PLOTAND COUNTERPLOT  AND BEHIND ALL  EVER MENACING  WAS DEATH  VIOLENT ANDTERRIBLE  MEN AND WOMEN DISAPPEARED  OUR NEAREST AND DEAREST COMRADES WE SAW THEM TO DAY  TO MORROW THEY WERE GONE  WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN AND WE KNEW THAT THEY HAD DIED THERE WAS NO TRUST  NO CONFIDENCE ANYWHERE  THE MAN WHO PLOTTED BESIDEUS  FOR ALL WE KNEW  MIGHT BE AN AGENT OF THE IRON HEEL  WE MINED THEORGANIZATION OF THE IRON HEEL WITH OUR SECRET AGENTS  AND THE IRON HEELCOUNTERMINED WITH ITS SECRET AGENTS INSIDE ITS OWN ORGANIZATION  ANDIT WAS THE SAME WITH OUR ORGANIZATION  AND DESPITE THE ABSENCE OFCONFIDENCE AND TRUST WE WERE COMPELLED TO BASE OUR EVERY EFFORT ONCONFIDENCE AND TRUST  OFTEN WERE WE BETRAYED  MEN WERE WEAK  THE IRONHEEL COULD OFFER MONEY  LEISURE  THE JOYS AND PLEASURES THAT WAITEDIN THE REPOSE OF THE WONDER CITIES  WE COULD OFFER NOTHING BUT THESATISFACTION OF BEING FAITHFUL TO A NOBLE IDEAL  AS FOR THE REST  THEWAGES OF THOSE WHO WERE LOYAL WERE UNCEASING PERIL  TORTURE  AND DEATH MEN WERE WEAK  I SAY  AND BECAUSE OF THEIR WEAKNESS WE WERE COMPELLED TOMAKE THE ONLY OTHER REWARD THAT WAS WITHIN OUR POWER  IT WAS THE REWARDOF DEATH  OUT OF NECESSITY WE HAD TO PUNISH OUR TRAITORS  FOR EVERY MANWHO BETRAYED US  FROM ONE TO A DOZEN FAITHFUL AVENGERS WERE LOOSED UPONHIS HEELS  WE MIGHT FAIL TO CARRY OUT OUR DECREES AGAINST OUR ENEMIES SUCH AS THE POCOCKS  FOR INSTANCE  BUT THE ONE THING WE COULD NOT AFFORDTO FAIL IN WAS THE PUNISHMENT OF OUR OWN TRAITORS  COMRADES TURNEDTRAITOR BY PERMISSION  IN ORDER TO WIN TO THE WONDER CITIES AND THEREEXECUTE OUR SENTENCES ON THE REAL TRAITORS  IN FACT  SO TERRIBLE DIDWE MAKE OURSELVES  THAT IT BECAME A GREATER PERIL TO BETRAY US THAN TOREMAIN LOYAL TO US THE REVOLUTION TOOK ON LARGELY THE CHARACTER OF RELIGION  WE WORSHIPPEDAT THE SHRINE OF THE REVOLUTION  WHICH WAS THE SHRINE OF LIBERTY  IT WASTHE DIVINE FLASHING THROUGH US  MEN AND WOMEN DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TOTHE CAUSE  AND NEW BORN BABES WERE SEALED TO IT AS OF OLD THEY HAD BEENSEALED TO THE SERVICE OF GOD  WE WERE LOVERS OF HUMANITY CHAPTER XVIITHE SCARLET LIVERYWITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE GRANGER STATES  THE GRANGERS IN CONGRESSDISAPPEARED  THEY WERE BEING TRIED FOR HIGH TREASON  AND THEIR PLACESWERE TAKEN BY THE CREATURES OF THE IRON HEEL  THE SOCIALISTS WERE IN APITIFUL MINORITY  AND THEY KNEW THAT THEIR END WAS NEAR  CONGRESS ANDTHE SENATE WERE EMPTY PRETENCES  FARCES  PUBLIC QUESTIONS WERE GRAVELYDEBATED AND PASSED UPON ACCORDING TO THE OLD FORMS  WHILE IN REALITY ALLTHAT WAS DONE WAS TO GIVE THE STAMP OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURE TO THEMANDATES OF THE OLIGARCHY ERNEST WAS IN THE THICK OF THE FIGHT WHEN THE END CAME  IT WAS IN THEDEBATE ON THE BILL TO ASSIST THE UNEMPLOYED  THE HARD TIMES OF THEPRECEDING YEAR HAD THRUST GREAT MASSES OF THE PROLETARIAT BENEATH THESTARVATION LINE  AND THE CONTINUED AND WIDE REACHING DISORDER HAD BUTSUNK THEM DEEPER  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE STARVING  WHILE THE OLIGARCHSAND THEIR SUPPORTERS WERE SURFEITING ON THE SURPLUS   WE CALLED THESEWRETCHED PEOPLE THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS    AND IT WAS TO ALLEVIATE THEIRAWFUL SUFFERING THAT THE SOCIALISTS HAD INTRODUCED THE UNEMPLOYED BILL BUT THIS WAS NOT TO THE FANCY OF THE IRON HEEL  IN ITS OWN WAY IT WASPREPARING TO SET THESE MILLIONS TO WORK  BUT THE WAY WAS NOT OUR WAY WHEREFORE IT HAD ISSUED ITS ORDERS THAT OUR BILL SHOULD BE VOTED DOWN ERNEST AND HIS FELLOWS KNEW THAT THEIR EFFORT WAS FUTILE  BUT THEYWERE TIRED OF THE SUSPENSE  THEY WANTED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN  THEY WEREACCOMPLISHING NOTHING  AND THE BEST THEY HOPED FOR WAS THE PUTTING OF ANEND TO THE LEGISLATIVE FARCE IN WHICH THEY WERE UNWILLING PLAYERS THEY KNEW NOT WHAT END WOULD COME  BUT THEY NEVER ANTICIPATED A MOREDISASTROUS END THAN THE ONE THAT DID COME        THE SAME CONDITIONS OBTAINED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY     A D  UNDER BRITISH RULE IN INDIA   THE NATIVES DIED OF     STARVATION BY THE MILLION  WHILE THEIR RULERS ROBBED THEM OF     THE FRUITS OF THEIR TOIL AND EXPENDED IT ON MAGNIFICENT     PAGEANTS AND MUMBO JUMBO FOOLERIES  PERFORCE  IN THIS     ENLIGHTENED AGE  WE HAVE MUCH TO BLUSH FOR IN THE ACTS OF     OUR ANCESTORS   OUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS PHILOSOPHIC   WE     MUST ACCEPT THE CAPITALISTIC STAGE IN SOCIAL EVOLUTION AS     ABOUT ON A PAR WITH THE EARLIER MONKEY STAGE   THE HUMAN HAD     TO PASS THROUGH THOSE STAGES IN ITS RISE FROM THE MIRE AND     SLIME OF LOW ORGANIC LIFE   IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT MUCH OF     THE MIRE AND SLIME SHOULD CLING AND BE NOT EASILY SHAKEN     OFF         THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  THIS PHRASE WAS STRUCK OUT BY     THE GENIUS OF H  G  WELLS IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY     A D   WELLS WAS A SOCIOLOGICAL SEER  SANE AND NORMAL AS WELL     AS WARM HUMAN  MANY FRAGMENTS OF HIS WORK HAVE COME DOWN TO     US  WHILE TWO OF HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS   ANTICIPATIONS      AND  MANKIND IN THE MAKING   HAVE COME DOWN INTACT   BEFORE     THE OLIGARCHS  AND BEFORE EVERHARD  WELLS SPECULATED UPON     THE BUILDING OF THE WONDER CITIES  THOUGH IN HIS WRITINGS     THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS  PLEASURE CITIES  I SAT IN THE GALLERY THAT DAY  WE ALL KNEW THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE WASIMMINENT  IT WAS IN THE AIR  AND ITS PRESENCE WAS MADE VISIBLE BY THEARMED SOLDIERS DRAWN UP IN LINES IN THE CORRIDORS  AND BY THE OFFICERSGROUPED IN THE ENTRANCES TO THE HOUSE ITSELF  THE OLIGARCHY WAS ABOUTTO STRIKE  ERNEST WAS SPEAKING  HE WAS DESCRIBING THE SUFFERINGS OFTHE UNEMPLOYED  AS IF WITH THE WILD IDEA OF IN SOME WAY TOUCHING THEIRHEARTS AND CONSCIENCES  BUT THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC MEMBERSSNEERED AND JEERED AT HIM  AND THERE WAS UPROAR AND CONFUSION  ERNESTABRUPTLY CHANGED FRONT  I KNOW NOTHING THAT I MAY SAY CAN INFLUENCE YOU   HE SAID   YOU HAVE NOSOULS TO BE INFLUENCED  YOU ARE SPINELESS  FLACCID THINGS  YOU POMPOUSLYCALL YOURSELVES REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS  THERE IS NO REPUBLICAN PARTY THERE IS NO DEMOCRATIC PARTY  THERE ARE NO REPUBLICANS NOR DEMOCRATS INTHIS HOUSE  YOU ARE LICK SPITTLERS AND PANDERERS  THE CREATURES OF THEPLUTOCRACY  YOU TALK VERBOSELY IN ANTIQUATED TERMINOLOGY OF YOUR LOVEOF LIBERTY  AND ALL THE WHILE YOU WEAR THE SCARLET LIVERY OF THE IRONHEEL  HERE THE SHOUTING AND THE CRIES OF  ORDER  ORDER   DROWNED HIS VOICE AND HE STOOD DISDAINFULLY TILL THE DIN HAD SOMEWHAT SUBSIDED  HE WAVEDHIS HAND TO INCLUDE ALL OF THEM  TURNED TO HIS OWN COMRADES  AND SAID  LISTEN TO THE BELLOWING OF THE WELL FED BEASTS  PANDEMONIUM BROKE OUT AGAIN  THE SPEAKER RAPPED FOR ORDER AND GLANCEDEXPECTANTLY AT THE OFFICERS IN THE DOORWAYS  THERE WERE CRIES OF SEDITION   AND A GREAT  ROTUND NEW YORK MEMBER BEGAN SHOUTING ANARCHIST   AT ERNEST  AND ERNEST WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK AT  EVERYFIGHTING FIBRE OF HIM WAS QUIVERING  AND HIS FACE WAS THE FACE OF AFIGHTING ANIMAL  WITHAL HE WAS COOL AND COLLECTED  REMEMBER   HE SAID  IN A VOICE THAT MADE ITSELF HEARD ABOVE THE DIN  THAT AS YOU SHOW MERCY NOW TO THE PROLETARIAT  SOME DAY WILL THAT SAMEPROLETARIAT SHOW MERCY TO YOU  THE CRIES OF  SEDITION   AND  ANARCHIST   REDOUBLED  I KNOW THAT YOU WILL NOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL   ERNEST WENT ON   YOU HAVERECEIVED THE COMMAND FROM YOUR MASTERS TO VOTE AGAINST IT  AND YET YOUCALL ME ANARCHIST  YOU  WHO HAVE DESTROYED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE AND WHO SHAMELESSLY FLAUNT YOUR SCARLET SHAME IN PUBLIC PLACES  CALL MEANARCHIST  I DO NOT BELIEVE IN HELL FIRE AND BRIMSTONE  BUT IN MOMENTSLIKE THIS I REGRET MY UNBELIEF  NAY  IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS I ALMOST DOBELIEVE  SURELY THERE MUST BE A HELL  FOR IN NO LESS PLACE COULD IT BEPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RECEIVE PUNISHMENT ADEQUATE TO YOUR CRIMES  SO LONGAS YOU EXIST  THERE IS A VITAL NEED FOR HELL FIRE IN THE COSMOS  THERE WAS MOVEMENT IN THE DOORWAYS  ERNEST  THE SPEAKER  ALL THE MEMBERSTURNED TO SEE  WHY DO YOU NOT CALL YOUR SOLDIERS IN  MR  SPEAKER  AND BID THEM DOTHEIR WORK   ERNEST DEMANDED   THEY SHOULD CARRY OUT YOUR PLAN WITHEXPEDITION   THERE ARE OTHER PLANS AFOOT   WAS THE RETORT   THAT IS WHY THE SOLDIERSARE PRESENT   OUR PLANS  I SUPPOSE   ERNEST SNEERED   ASSASSINATION OR SOMETHINGKINDRED  BUT AT THE WORD  ASSASSINATION  THE UPROAR BROKE OUT AGAIN  ERNEST COULDNOT MAKE HIMSELF HEARD  BUT HE REMAINED ON HIS FEET WAITING FOR A LULL AND THEN IT HAPPENED  FROM MY PLACE IN THE GALLERY I SAW NOTHING EXCEPTTHE FLASH OF THE EXPLOSION  THE ROAR OF IT FILLED MY EARS AND I SAWERNEST REELING AND FALLING IN A SWIRL OF SMOKE  AND THE SOLDIERS RUSHINGUP ALL THE AISLES  HIS COMRADES WERE ON THEIR FEET  WILD WITH ANGER CAPABLE OF ANY VIOLENCE  BUT ERNEST STEADIED HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT  ANDWAVED HIS ARMS FOR SILENCE  IT IS A PLOT   HIS VOICE RANG OUT IN WARNING TO HIS COMRADES   DONOTHING  OR YOU WILL BE DESTROYED  THEN HE SLOWLY SANK DOWN  AND THE SOLDIERS REACHED HIM  THE NEXT MOMENTSOLDIERS WERE CLEARING THE GALLERIES AND I SAW NO MORE THOUGH HE WAS MY HUSBAND  I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO GET TO HIM  WHEN IANNOUNCED WHO I WAS  I WAS PROMPTLY PLACED UNDER ARREST  AND AT THE SAMETIME WERE ARRESTED ALL SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN IN WASHINGTON  INCLUDINGTHE UNFORTUNATE SIMPSON  WHO LAY ILL WITH TYPHOID FEVER IN HIS HOTEL THE TRIAL WAS PROMPT AND BRIEF  THE MEN WERE FOREDOOMED  THE WONDERWAS THAT ERNEST WAS NOT EXECUTED  THIS WAS A BLUNDER ON THE PART OFTHE OLIGARCHY  AND A COSTLY ONE  BUT THE OLIGARCHY WAS TOO CONFIDENT INTHOSE DAYS  IT WAS DRUNK WITH SUCCESS  AND LITTLE DID IT DREAM THATTHAT SMALL HANDFUL OF HEROES HAD WITHIN THEM THE POWER TO ROCK IT TOITS FOUNDATIONS  TO MORROW  WHEN THE GREAT REVOLT BREAKS OUT AND ALLTHE WORLD RESOUNDS WITH THE TRAMP  TRAMP OF THE MILLIONS  THE OLIGARCHY WILL REALIZE  AND TOO LATE  HOW MIGHTILY THAT BAND OF HEROES HAS GROWN         AVIS EVERHARD TOOK FOR GRANTED THAT HER NARRATIVE WOULD BE     READ IN HER OWN DAY  AND SO OMITS TO MENTION THE OUTCOME OF     THE TRIAL FOR HIGH TREASON   MANY OTHER SIMILAR     DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT      FIFTY TWO SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN WERE TRIED  AND ALL WERE     FOUND GUILTY   STRANGE TO RELATE  NOT ONE RECEIVED THE DEATH     SENTENCE   EVERHARD AND ELEVEN OTHERS  AMONG WHOM WERE     THEODORE DONNELSON AND MATTHEW KENT  RECEIVED LIFE     IMPRISONMENT   THE REMAINING FORTY RECEIVED SENTENCES     VARYING FROM THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE YEARS  WHILE ARTHUR     SIMPSON  REFERRED TO IN THE MANUSCRIPT AS BEING ILL OF     TYPHOID FEVER AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION  RECEIVED ONLY     FIFTEEN YEARS   IT IS THE TRADITION THAT HE DIED OF     STARVATION IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT  AND THIS HARSH TREATMENT     IS EXPLAINED AS HAVING BEEN CAUSED BY HIS UNCOMPROMISING     STUBBORNNESS AND HIS FIERY AND TACTLESS HATRED FOR ALL MEN     THAT SERVED THE DESPOTISM   HE DIED IN CABANAS IN CUBA      WHERE THREE OF HIS COMRADES WERE ALSO CONFINED   THE FIFTY      TWO SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN WERE CONFINED IN MILITARY     FORTRESSES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES   THUS  DU     BOIS AND WOODS WERE HELD IN PORTO RICO  WHILE EVERHARD AND     MERRYWEATHER WERE PLACED IN ALCATRAZ  AN ISLAND IN SAN     FRANCISCO BAY THAT HAD ALREADY SEEN LONG SERVICE AS A     MILITARY PRISON AS A REVOLUTIONIST MYSELF  AS ONE ON THE INSIDE WHO KNEW THE HOPES ANDFEARS AND SECRET PLANS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  I AM FITTED TO ANSWER  ASVERY FEW ARE  THE CHARGE THAT THEY WERE GUILTY OF EXPLODING THE BOMB INCONGRESS  AND I CAN SAY FLATLY  WITHOUT QUALIFICATION OR DOUBT OF ANYSORT  THAT THE SOCIALISTS  IN CONGRESS AND OUT  HAD NO HAND IN THEAFFAIR  WHO THREW THE BOMB WE DO NOT KNOW  BUT THE ONE THING WE AREABSOLUTELY SURE OF IS THAT WE DID NOT THROW IT ON THE OTHER HAND  THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE IRON HEEL WASRESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACT  OF COURSE  WE CANNOT PROVE THIS  OUR CONCLUSIONIS MERELY PRESUMPTIVE  BUT HERE ARE SUCH FACTS AS WE DO KNOW  IT HADBEEN REPORTED TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE  BY SECRET SERVICE AGENTS OFTHE GOVERNMENT  THAT THE SOCIALIST CONGRESSMEN WERE ABOUT TO RESORT TOTERRORISTIC TACTICS  AND THAT THEY HAD DECIDED UPON THE DAY WHENTHEIR TACTICS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT  THIS DAY WAS THE VERY DAY OFTHE EXPLOSION  WHEREFORE THE CAPITOL HAD BEEN PACKED WITH TROOPS INANTICIPATION  SINCE WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BOMB  AND SINCE A BOMBACTUALLY WAS EXPLODED  AND SINCE THE AUTHORITIES HAD PREPARED IN ADVANCEFOR THE EXPLOSION  IT IS ONLY FAIR TO CONCLUDE THAT THE IRON HEELDID KNOW  FURTHERMORE  WE CHARGE THAT THE IRON HEEL WAS GUILTY OF THEOUTRAGE  AND THAT THE IRON HEEL PLANNED AND PERPETRATED THE OUTRAGE FORTHE PURPOSE OF FOISTING THE GUILT ON OUR SHOULDERS AND SO BRINGING ABOUTOUR DESTRUCTION FROM THE SPEAKER THE WARNING LEAKED OUT TO ALL THE CREATURES INTHE HOUSE THAT WORE THE SCARLET LIVERY  THEY KNEW  WHILE ERNEST WASSPEAKING  THAT SOME VIOLENT ACT WAS TO BE COMMITTED  AND TO DO THEMJUSTICE  THEY HONESTLY BELIEVED THAT THE ACT WAS TO BE COMMITTED BYTHE SOCIALISTS  AT THE TRIAL  AND STILL WITH HONEST BELIEF  SEVERALTESTIFIED TO HAVING SEEN ERNEST PREPARE TO THROW THE BOMB  AND THAT ITEXPLODED PREMATURELY  OF COURSE THEY SAW NOTHING OF THE SORT  IN THEFEVERED IMAGINATION OF FEAR THEY THOUGHT THEY SAW  THAT WAS ALL AS ERNEST SAID AT THE TRIAL   DOES IT STAND TO REASON  IF I WERE GOINGTO THROW A BOMB  THAT I SHOULD ELECT TO THROW A FEEBLE LITTLE SQUIB LIKETHE ONE THAT WAS THROWN  THERE WASN T ENOUGH POWDER IN IT  IT MADE A LOTOF SMOKE  BUT HURT NO ONE EXCEPT ME  IT EXPLODED RIGHT AT MY FEET  ANDYET IT DID NOT KILL ME  BELIEVE ME  WHEN I GET TO THROWING BOMBS  I LLDO DAMAGE  THERE LL BE MORE THAN SMOKE IN MY PETARDS  IN RETURN IT WAS ARGUED BY THE PROSECUTION THAT THE WEAKNESS OF THEBOMB WAS A BLUNDER ON THE PART OF THE SOCIALISTS  JUST AS ITS PREMATUREEXPLOSION  CAUSED BY ERNEST S LOSING HIS NERVE AND DROPPING IT  WAS ABLUNDER  AND TO CLINCH THE ARGUMENT  THERE WERE THE SEVERAL CONGRESSMENWHO TESTIFIED TO HAVING SEEN ERNEST FUMBLE AND DROP THE BOMB AS FOR OURSELVES  NOT ONE OF US KNEW HOW THE BOMB WAS THROWN  ERNESTTOLD ME THAT THE FRACTION OF AN INSTANT BEFORE IT EXPLODED HE BOTH HEARDAND SAW IT STRIKE AT HIS FEET  HE TESTIFIED TO THIS AT THE TRIAL  BUTNO ONE BELIEVED HIM  BESIDES  THE WHOLE THING  IN POPULAR SLANG  WAS COOKED UP   THE IRON HEEL HAD MADE UP ITS MIND TO DESTROY US  AND THEREWAS NO WITHSTANDING IT THERE IS A SAYING THAT TRUTH WILL OUT  I HAVE COME TO DOUBT THAT SAYING NINETEEN YEARS HAVE ELAPSED  AND DESPITE OUR UNTIRING EFFORTS  WE HAVEFAILED TO FIND THE MAN WHO REALLY DID THROW THE BOMB  UNDOUBTEDLY HE WASSOME EMISSARY OF THE IRON HEEL  BUT HE HAS ESCAPED DETECTION  WE HAVENEVER GOT THE SLIGHTEST CLEW TO HIS IDENTITY  AND NOW  AT THIS LATEDATE  NOTHING REMAINS BUT FOR THE AFFAIR TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG THEMYSTERIES OF HISTORY         AVIS EVERHARD WOULD HAVE HAD TO LIVE FOR MANY GENERATIONS     ERE SHE COULD HAVE SEEN THE CLEARING UP OF THIS PARTICULAR     MYSTERY   A LITTLE LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO  AND A     LITTLE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE DEATH  THE     CONFESSION OF PERVAISE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE SECRET ARCHIVES     OF THE VATICAN   IT IS PERHAPS WELL TO TELL A LITTLE     SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OBSCURE DOCUMENT  WHICH  IN THE MAIN      IS OF INTEREST TO THE HISTORIAN ONLY      PERVAISE WAS AN AMERICAN  OF FRENCH DESCENT  WHO IN          A D   WAS LYING IN THE TOMBS PRISON  NEW YORK CITY  AWAITING     TRIAL FOR MURDER   FROM HIS CONFESSION WE LEARN THAT HE WAS     NOT A CRIMINAL  HE WAS WARM BLOODED  PASSIONATE  EMOTIONAL      IN AN INSANE FIT OF JEALOUSY HE KILLED HIS WIFE  A VERY     COMMON ACT IN THOSE TIMES  PERVAISE WAS MASTERED BY THE FEAR     OF DEATH  ALL OF WHICH IS RECOUNTED AT LENGTH IN HIS     CONFESSION   TO ESCAPE DEATH HE WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING      AND THE POLICE AGENTS PREPARED HIM BY ASSURING HIM THAT HE     COULD NOT POSSIBLY ESCAPE CONVICTION OF MURDER IN THE FIRST     DEGREE WHEN HIS TRIAL CAME OFF   IN THOSE DAYS  MURDER IN     THE FIRST DEGREE WAS A CAPITAL OFFENSE   THE GUILTY MAN OR     WOMAN WAS PLACED IN A SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED DEATH CHAIR      AND  UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF COMPETENT PHYSICIANS  WAS     DESTROYED BY A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY   THIS WAS CALLED     ELECTROCUTION  AND IT WAS VERY POPULAR DURING THAT PERIOD      ANAESTHESIA  AS A MODE OF COMPULSORY DEATH  WAS NOT     INTRODUCED UNTIL LATER      THIS MAN  GOOD AT HEART BUT WITH A FEROCIOUS ANIMALISM CLOSE     AT THE SURFACE OF HIS BEING  LYING IN JAIL AND EXPECTANT OF     NOTHING LESS THAN DEATH  WAS PREVAILED UPON BY THE AGENTS OF     THE IRON HEEL TO THROW THE BOMB IN THE HOUSE OF     REPRESENTATIVES   IN HIS CONFESSION HE STATES EXPLICITLY     THAT HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE BOMB WAS TO BE A FEEBLE THING     AND THAT NO LIVES WOULD BE LOST   THIS IS DIRECTLY IN LINE     WITH THE FACT THAT THE BOMB WAS LIGHTLY CHARGED  AND THAT     ITS EXPLOSION AT EVERHARD S FEET WAS NOT DEADLY      PERVAISE WAS SMUGGLED INTO ONE OF THE GALLERIES OSTENSIBLY     CLOSED FOR REPAIRS   HE WAS TO SELECT THE MOMENT FOR THE     THROWING OF THE BOMB  AND HE NAIVELY CONFESSES THAT IN HIS     INTEREST IN EVERHARD S TIRADE AND THE GENERAL COMMOTION     RAISED THEREBY  HE NEARLY FORGOT HIS MISSION      NOT ONLY WAS HE RELEASED FROM PRISON IN REWARD FOR HIS DEED      BUT HE WAS GRANTED AN INCOME FOR LIFE   THIS HE DID NOT LONG     ENJOY   IN      A D   IN SEPTEMBER  HE WAS STRICKEN WITH     RHEUMATISM OF THE HEART AND LIVED FOR THREE DAYS   IT WAS     THEN THAT HE SENT FOR THE CATHOLIC PRIEST  FATHER PETER     DURBAN  AND TO HIM MADE CONFESSION  SO IMPORTANT DID IT SEEM     TO THE PRIEST  THAT HE HAD THE CONFESSION TAKEN DOWN IN     WRITING AND SWORN TO   WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THIS WE CAN ONLY     SURMISE   THE DOCUMENT WAS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO     FIND ITS WAY TO ROME   POWERFUL INFLUENCES MUST HAVE BEEN     BROUGHT TO BEAR  HENCE ITS SUPPRESSION   FOR CENTURIES NO     HINT OF ITS EXISTENCE REACHED THE WORLD   IT WAS NOT UNTIL     IN THE LAST CENTURY THAT LORBIA  THE BRILLIANT ITALIAN     SCHOLAR  STUMBLED UPON IT QUITE BY CHANCE DURING HIS     RESEARCHES IN THE VATICAN      THERE IS TO DAY NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THE IRON HEEL WAS     RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED IN THE HOUSE OF     REPRESENTATIVES IN      A D   EVEN THOUGH THE PERVAISE     CONFESSION HAD NEVER COME TO LIGHT  NO REASONABLE DOUBT     COULD OBTAIN  FOR THE ACT IN QUESTION  THAT SENT FIFTY TWO     CONGRESSMEN TO PRISON  WAS ON A PAR WITH COUNTLESS OTHER     ACTS COMMITTED BY THE OLIGARCHS  AND  BEFORE THEM  BY THE     CAPITALISTS      THERE IS THE CLASSIC INSTANCE OF THE FEROCIOUS AND WANTON     JUDICIAL MURDER OF THE INNOCENT AND SO CALLED HAYMARKET     ANARCHISTS IN CHICAGO IN THE PENULTIMATE DECADE OF THE     NINETEENTH CENTURY A D  IN A CATEGORY BY ITSELF IS THE     DELIBERATE BURNING AND DESTRUCTION OF CAPITALIST PROPERTY BY     THE CAPITALISTS THEMSELVES   FOR SUCH DESTRUCTION OF     PROPERTY INNOCENT MEN WERE FREQUENTLY PUNISHED   RAILROADED      IN THE PARLANCE OF THE TIMES      IN THE LABOR TROUBLES OF THE FIRST DECADE OF THE TWENTIETH     CENTURY A D   BETWEEN THE CAPITALISTS AND THE WESTERN     FEDERATION OF MINERS  SIMILAR BUT MORE BLOODY TACTICS WERE     EMPLOYED   THE RAILROAD STATION AT INDEPENDENCE WAS BLOWN UP     BY THE AGENTS OF THE CAPITALISTS   THIRTEEN MEN WERE KILLED      AND MANY MORE WERE WOUNDED  AND THEN THE CAPITALISTS      CONTROLLING THE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL MACHINERY OF THE     STATE OF COLORADO  CHARGED THE MINERS WITH THE CRIME AND     CAME VERY NEAR TO CONVICTING THEM   ROMAINES  ONE OF THE     TOOLS IN THIS AFFAIR  LIKE PERVAISE  WAS LYING IN JAIL IN     ANOTHER STATE  KANSAS  AWAITING TRIAL  WHEN HE WAS     APPROACHED BY THE AGENTS OF THE CAPITALISTS   BUT  UNLIKE     PERVAISE THE CONFESSION OF ROMAINES WAS MADE PUBLIC IN HIS     OWN TIME      THEN  DURING THIS SAME PERIOD  THERE WAS THE CASE OF MOYER     AND HAYWOOD  TWO STRONG  FEARLESS LEADERS OF LABOR   ONE WAS     PRESIDENT AND THE OTHER WAS SECRETARY OF THE WESTERN     FEDERATION OF MINERS  THE EX GOVERNOR OF IDAHO HAD BEEN     MYSTERIOUSLY MURDERED   THE CRIME  AT THE TIME  WAS OPENLY     CHARGED TO THE MINE OWNERS BY THE SOCIALISTS AND MINERS      NEVERTHELESS  IN VIOLATION OF THE NATIONAL AND STATE     CONSTITUTIONS  AND BY MEANS OF CONSPIRACY ON THE PARTS OF     THE GOVERNORS OF IDAHO AND COLORADO  MOYER AND HAYWOOD WERE     KIDNAPPED  THROWN INTO JAIL  AND CHARGED WITH THE MURDER      IT WAS THIS INSTANCE THAT PROVOKED FROM EUGENE V  DEBS      NATIONAL LEADER OF THE AMERICAN SOCIALISTS AT THE TIME  THE     FOLLOWING WORDS   THE LABOR LEADERS THAT CANNOT BE BRIBED     NOR BULLIED  MUST BE AMBUSHED AND MURDERED   THE ONLY CRIME     OF MOYER AND HAYWOOD IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN UNSWERVINGLY     TRUE TO THE WORKING CLASS   THE CAPITALISTS HAVE STOLEN OUR     COUNTRY  DEBAUCHED OUR POLITICS  DEFILED OUR JUDICIARY  AND     RIDDEN OVER US ROUGH SHOD  AND NOW THEY PROPOSE TO MURDER     THOSE WHO WILL NOT ABJECTLY SURRENDER TO THEIR BRUTAL     DOMINION   THE GOVERNORS OF COLORADO AND IDAHO ARE BUT     EXECUTING THE MANDATES OF THEIR MASTERS  THE PLUTOCRACY      THE ISSUE IS THE WORKERS VERSUS THE PLUTOCRACY   IF THEY     STRIKE THE FIRST VIOLENT BLOW  WE WILL STRIKE THE LAST  CHAPTER XVIIIIN THE SHADOW OF SONOMAOF MYSELF  DURING THIS PERIOD  THERE IS NOT MUCH TO SAY  FOR SIX MONTHSI WAS KEPT IN PRISON  THOUGH CHARGED WITH NO CRIME  I WAS A SUSPECT  AWORD OF FEAR THAT ALL REVOLUTIONISTS WERE SOON TO COME TO KNOW  BUTOUR OWN NASCENT SECRET SERVICE WAS BEGINNING TO WORK  BY THE END OFMY SECOND MONTH IN PRISON  ONE OF THE JAILERS MADE HIMSELF KNOWN ASA REVOLUTIONIST IN TOUCH WITH THE ORGANIZATION  SEVERAL WEEKS LATER JOSEPH PARKHURST  THE PRISON DOCTOR WHO HAD JUST BEEN APPOINTED  PROVEDHIMSELF TO BE A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS THUS  THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE OLIGARCHY  OUR OWNORGANIZATION  WEBLIKE AND SPIDERY  WAS INSINUATING ITSELF  AND SO IWAS KEPT IN TOUCH WITH ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WITHOUT  ANDFURTHERMORE  EVERY ONE OF OUR IMPRISONED LEADERS WAS IN CONTACT WITHBRAVE COMRADES WHO MASQUERADED IN THE LIVERY OF THE IRON HEEL  THOUGHERNEST LAY IN PRISON THREE THOUSAND MILES AWAY  ON THE PACIFIC COAST  IWAS IN UNBROKEN COMMUNICATION WITH HIM  AND OUR LETTERS PASSED REGULARLYBACK AND FORTH THE LEADERS  IN PRISON AND OUT  WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS AND DIRECT THECAMPAIGN  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE  WITHIN A FEW MONTHS  TO HAVEEFFECTED THE ESCAPE OF SOME OF THEM  BUT SINCE IMPRISONMENT PROVEDNO BAR TO OUR ACTIVITIES  IT WAS DECIDED TO AVOID ANYTHING PREMATURE FIFTY TWO CONGRESSMEN WERE IN PRISON  AND FULLY THREE HUNDRED MOREOF OUR LEADERS  IT WAS PLANNED THAT THEY SHOULD BE DELIVEREDSIMULTANEOUSLY  IF PART OF THEM ESCAPED  THE VIGILANCE OF THE OLIGARCHSMIGHT BE AROUSED SO AS TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF THE REMAINDER  ON THEOTHER HAND  IT WAS HELD THAT A SIMULTANEOUS JAIL DELIVERY ALL OVER THELAND WOULD HAVE IMMENSE PSYCHOLOGICAL INFLUENCE ON THE PROLETARIAT  ITWOULD SHOW OUR STRENGTH AND GIVE CONFIDENCE SO IT WAS ARRANGED  WHEN I WAS RELEASED AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS  THATI WAS TO DISAPPEAR AND PREPARE A SECURE HIDING PLACE FOR ERNEST  TODISAPPEAR WAS IN ITSELF NO EASY THING  NO SOONER DID I GET MY FREEDOMTHAN MY FOOTSTEPS BEGAN TO BE DOGGED BY THE SPIES OF THE IRON HEEL IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD BE THROWN OFF THE TRACK  AND THATI SHOULD WIN TO CALIFORNIA  IT IS LAUGHABLE  THE WAY THIS WASACCOMPLISHED ALREADY THE PASSPORT SYSTEM  MODELLED ON THE RUSSIAN  WAS DEVELOPING  IDARED NOT CROSS THE CONTINENT IN MY OWN CHARACTER  IT WAS NECESSARY THATI SHOULD BE COMPLETELY LOST IF EVER I WAS TO SEE ERNEST AGAIN  FOR BYTRAILING ME AFTER HE ESCAPED  HE WOULD BE CAUGHT ONCE MORE  AGAIN  ICOULD NOT DISGUISE MYSELF AS A PROLETARIAN AND TRAVEL  THERE REMAINEDTHE DISGUISE OF A MEMBER OF THE OLIGARCHY  WHILE THE ARCH OLIGARCHS WERENO MORE THAN A HANDFUL  THERE WERE MYRIADS OF LESSER ONES OF THE TYPE SAY  OF MR  WICKSON  MEN  WORTH A FEW MILLIONS  WHO WERE ADHERENTS OFTHE ARCH OLIGARCHS  THE WIVES AND DAUGHTERS OF THESE LESSER OLIGARCHSWERE LEGION  AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT I SHOULD ASSUME THE DISGUISE OFSUCH A ONE  A FEW YEARS LATER THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE  BECAUSETHE PASSPORT SYSTEM WAS TO BECOME SO PERFECT THAT NO MAN  WOMAN  NORCHILD IN ALL THE LAND WAS UNREGISTERED AND UNACCOUNTED FOR IN HIS OR HERMOVEMENTS WHEN THE TIME WAS RIPE  THE SPIES WERE THROWN OFF MY TRACK  AN HOURLATER AVIS EVERHARD WAS NO MORE  AT THAT TIME ONE FELICE VAN VERDIGHAN ACCOMPANIED BY TWO MAIDS AND A LAP DOG  WITH ANOTHER MAID FOR THELAP DOG   ENTERED A DRAWING ROOM ON A PULLMAN    AND A FEW MINUTES LATERWAS SPEEDING WEST        THIS RIDICULOUS PICTURE WELL ILLUSTRATES THE HEARTLESS     CONDUCT OF THE MASTERS   WHILE PEOPLE STARVED  LAP DOGS WERE     WAITED UPON BY MAIDS   THIS WAS A SERIOUS MASQUERADE ON THE     PART OF AVIS EVERHARD  LIFE AND DEATH AND THE CAUSE WERE IN     THE ISSUE  THEREFORE THE PICTURE MUST BE ACCEPTED AS A TRUE     PICTURE   IT AFFORDS A STRIKING COMMENTARY OF THE TIMES         PULLMAN  THE DESIGNATION OF THE MORE LUXURIOUS RAILWAY     CARS OF THE PERIOD AND SO NAMED FROM THE INVENTOR THE THREE MAIDS WHO ACCOMPANIED ME WERE REVOLUTIONISTS  TWO WERE MEMBERSOF THE FIGHTING GROUPS  AND THE THIRD  GRACE HOLBROOK  ENTERED A GROUPTHE FOLLOWING YEAR  AND SIX MONTHS LATER WAS EXECUTED BY THE IRON HEEL SHE IT WAS WHO WAITED UPON THE DOG  OF THE OTHER TWO  BERTHA STOLEDISAPPEARED TWELVE YEARS LATER  WHILE ANNA ROYLSTON STILL LIVES ANDPLAYS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PART IN THE REVOLUTION         DESPITE CONTINUAL AND ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE HAZARDS  ANNA     ROYLSTON LIVED TO THE ROYAL AGE OF NINETY ONE   AS THE     POCOCKS DEFIED THE EXECUTIONERS OF THE FIGHTING GROUPS  SO     SHE DEFIED THE EXECUTIONERS OF THE IRON HEEL   SHE BORE A     CHARMED LIFE AND PROSPERED AMID DANGERS AND ALARMS   SHE     HERSELF WAS AN EXECUTIONER FOR THE FIGHTING GROUPS  AND      KNOWN AS THE RED VIRGIN  SHE BECAME ONE OF THE INSPIRED     FIGURES OF THE REVOLUTION   WHEN SHE WAS AN OLD WOMAN OF     SIXTY NINE SHE SHOT  BLOODY  HALCLIFFE DOWN IN THE MIDST OF     HIS ARMED ESCORT AND GOT AWAY UNSCATHED   IN THE END SHE     DIED PEACEABLY OF OLD AGE IN A SECRET REFUGE OF THE     REVOLUTIONISTS IN THE OZARK MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ADVENTURE WE CROSSED THE UNITED STATES TO CALIFORNIA  WHEN THETRAIN STOPPED AT SIXTEENTH STREET STATION  IN OAKLAND  WE ALIGHTED  ANDTHERE FELICE VAN VERDIGHAN  WITH HER TWO MAIDS  HER LAP DOG  ANDHER LAP DOG S MAID  DISAPPEARED FOREVER  THE MAIDS  GUIDED BY TRUSTYCOMRADES  WERE LED AWAY  OTHER COMRADES TOOK CHARGE OF ME  WITHIN HALFAN HOUR AFTER LEAVING THE TRAIN I WAS ON BOARD A SMALL FISHING BOATAND OUT ON THE WATERS OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY  THE WINDS BAFFLED  AND WEDRIFTED AIMLESSLY THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT  BUT I SAW THE LIGHTS OFALCATRAZ WHERE ERNEST LAY  AND FOUND COMFORT IN THE THOUGHT OF NEARNESSTO HIM  BY DAWN  WHAT WITH THE ROWING OF THE FISHERMEN  WE MADE THEMARIN ISLANDS  HERE WE LAY IN HIDING ALL DAY  AND ON THE FOLLOWINGNIGHT  SWEPT ON BY A FLOOD TIDE AND A FRESH WIND  WE CROSSED SAN PABLOBAY IN TWO HOURS AND RAN UP PETALUMA CREEK HERE HORSES WERE READY AND ANOTHER COMRADE  AND WITHOUT DELAY WE WEREAWAY THROUGH THE STARLIGHT  TO THE NORTH I COULD SEE THE LOOM OF SONOMAMOUNTAIN  TOWARD WHICH WE RODE  WE LEFT THE OLD TOWN OF SONOMA TO THERIGHT AND RODE UP A CANYON THAT LAY BETWEEN OUTLYING BUTTRESSES OF THEMOUNTAIN  THE WAGON ROAD BECAME A WOOD ROAD  THE WOOD ROAD BECAME ACOW PATH  AND THE COW PATH DWINDLED AWAY AND CEASED AMONG THE UPLANDPASTURES  STRAIGHT OVER SONOMA MOUNTAIN WE RODE  IT WAS THE SAFESTROUTE  THERE WAS NO ONE TO MARK OUR PASSING DAWN CAUGHT US ON THE NORTHERN BROW  AND IN THE GRAY LIGHT WE DROPPEDDOWN THROUGH CHAPARRAL INTO REDWOOD CANYONS DEEP AND WARM WITH THEBREATH OF PASSING SUMMER  IT WAS OLD COUNTRY TO ME THAT I KNEW ANDLOVED  AND SOON I BECAME THE GUIDE  THE HIDING PLACE WAS MINE  I HADSELECTED IT  WE LET DOWN THE BARS AND CROSSED AN UPLAND MEADOW  NEXT  WEWENT OVER A LOW  OAK COVERED RIDGE AND DESCENDED INTO A SMALLER MEADOW AGAIN WE CLIMBED A RIDGE  THIS TIME RIDING UNDER RED LIMBED MADRONOS ANDMANZANITAS OF DEEPER RED  THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN STREAMED UPONOUR BACKS AS WE CLIMBED  A FLIGHT OF QUAIL THRUMMED OFF THROUGH THETHICKETS  A BIG JACKRABBIT CROSSED OUR PATH  LEAPING SWIFTLY ANDSILENTLY LIKE A DEER  AND THEN A DEER  A MANY PRONGED BUCK  THE SUNFLASHING RED GOLD FROM NECK AND SHOULDERS  CLEARED THE CREST OF THERIDGE BEFORE US AND WAS GONE WE FOLLOWED IN HIS WAKE A SPACE  THEN DROPPED DOWN A ZIGZAG TRAIL THATHE DISDAINED INTO A GROUP OF NOBLE REDWOODS THAT STOOD ABOUT A POOL OFWATER MURKY WITH MINERALS FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE  I KNEW EVERY INCH OFTHE WAY  ONCE A WRITER FRIEND OF MINE HAD OWNED THE RANCH  BUT HE  TOO HAD BECOME A REVOLUTIONIST  THOUGH MORE DISASTROUSLY THAN I  FOR HE WASALREADY DEAD AND GONE  AND NONE KNEW WHERE NOR HOW  HE ALONE  IN THEDAYS HE HAD LIVED  KNEW THE SECRET OF THE HIDING PLACE FOR WHICH I WASBOUND  HE HAD BOUGHT THE RANCH FOR BEAUTY  AND PAID A ROUND PRICE FORIT  MUCH TO THE DISGUST OF THE LOCAL FARMERS  HE USED TO TELL WITH GREATGLEE HOW THEY WERE WONT TO SHAKE THEIR HEADS MOURNFULLY AT THE PRICE  TOACCOMPLISH PONDEROUSLY A BIT OF MENTAL ARITHMETIC  AND THEN TO SAY   BUTYOU CAN T MAKE SIX PER CENT ON IT  BUT HE WAS DEAD NOW  NOR DID THE RANCH DESCEND TO HIS CHILDREN  OF ALLMEN  IT WAS NOW THE PROPERTY OF MR  WICKSON  WHO OWNED THE WHOLE EASTERNAND NORTHERN SLOPES OF SONOMA MOUNTAIN  RUNNING FROM THE SPRECKELSESTATE TO THE DIVIDE OF BENNETT VALLEY  OUT OF IT HE HAD MADE AMAGNIFICENT DEER PARK  WHERE  OVER THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF SWEET SLOPESAND GLADES AND CANYONS  THE DEER RAN ALMOST IN PRIMITIVE WILDNESS  THEPEOPLE WHO HAD OWNED THE SOIL HAD BEEN DRIVEN AWAY  A STATE HOME FOR THEFEEBLE MINDED HAD ALSO BEEN DEMOLISHED TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE DEER TO CAP IT ALL  WICKSON S HUNTING LODGE WAS A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM MYHIDING PLACE  THIS  INSTEAD OF BEING A DANGER  WAS AN ADDED SECURITY WE WERE SHELTERED UNDER THE VERY AEGIS OF ONE OF THE MINOR OLIGARCHS SUSPICION  BY THE NATURE OF THE SITUATION  WAS TURNED ASIDE  THE LASTPLACE IN THE WORLD THE SPIES OF THE IRON HEEL WOULD DREAM OF LOOKING FORME  AND FOR ERNEST WHEN HE JOINED ME  WAS WICKSON S DEER PARK WE TIED OUR HORSES AMONG THE REDWOODS AT THE POOL  FROM A CACHE BEHINDA HOLLOW ROTTING LOG MY COMPANION BROUGHT OUT A VARIETY OF THINGS   AFIFTY POUND SACK OF FLOUR  TINNED FOODS OF ALL SORTS  COOKING UTENSILS BLANKETS  A CANVAS TARPAULIN  BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIAL  A GREAT BUNDLEOF LETTERS  A FIVE GALLON CAN OF KEROSENE  AN OIL STOVE  AND  LAST ANDMOST IMPORTANT  A LARGE COIL OF STOUT ROPE  SO LARGE WAS THE SUPPLY OFTHINGS THAT A NUMBER OF TRIPS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CARRY THEM TO THEREFUGE BUT THE REFUGE WAS VERY NEAR  TAKING THE ROPE AND LEADING THE WAY  IPASSED THROUGH A GLADE OF TANGLED VINES AND BUSHES THAT RAN BETWEEN TWOWOODED KNOLLS  THE GLADE ENDED ABRUPTLY AT THE STEEP BANK OF A STREAM IT WAS A LITTLE STREAM  RISING FROM SPRINGS  AND THE HOTTEST SUMMERNEVER DRIED IT UP  ON EVERY HAND WERE TALL WOODED KNOLLS  A GROUP OFTHEM  WITH ALL THE SEEMING OF HAVING BEEN FLUNG THERE FROM SOME CARELESSTITAN S HAND  THERE WAS NO BED ROCK IN THEM  THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BASESHUNDREDS OF FEET  AND THEY WERE COMPOSED OF RED VOLCANIC EARTH  THEFAMOUS WINE SOIL OF SONOMA  THROUGH THESE THE TINY STREAM HAD CUT ITSDEEP AND PRECIPITOUS CHANNEL IT WAS QUITE A SCRAMBLE DOWN TO THE STREAM BED  AND  ONCE ON THE BED WE WENT DOWN STREAM PERHAPS FOR A HUNDRED FEET  AND THEN WE CAME TO THEGREAT HOLE  THERE WAS NO WARNING OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE HOLE  NORWAS IT A HOLE IN THE COMMON SENSE OF THE WORD  ONE CRAWLED THROUGHTIGHT LOCKED BRIERS AND BRANCHES  AND FOUND ONESELF ON THE VERY EDGE PEERING OUT AND DOWN THROUGH A GREEN SCREEN  A COUPLE OF HUNDRED FEET INLENGTH AND WIDTH  IT WAS HALF OF THAT IN DEPTH  POSSIBLY BECAUSE OFSOME FAULT THAT HAD OCCURRED WHEN THE KNOLLS WERE FLUNG TOGETHER  ANDCERTAINLY HELPED BY FREAKISH EROSION  THE HOLE HAD BEEN SCOOPED OUT INTHE COURSE OF CENTURIES BY THE WASH OF WATER  NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTHAPPEAR  ALL WAS GARMENTED BY VEGETATION  FROM TINY MAIDEN HAIR ANDGOLD BACK FERNS TO MIGHTY REDWOOD AND DOUGLAS SPRUCES  THESE GREAT TREESEVEN SPRANG OUT FROM THE WALLS OF THE HOLE  SOME LEANED OVER AT ANGLESAS GREAT AS FORTY FIVE DEGREES  THOUGH THE MAJORITY TOWERED STRAIGHT UPFROM THE SOFT AND ALMOST PERPENDICULAR EARTH WALLS IT WAS A PERFECT HIDING PLACE  NO ONE EVER CAME THERE  NOT EVEN THEVILLAGE BOYS OF GLEN ELLEN  HAD THIS HOLE EXISTED IN THE BED OF A CANYONA MILE LONG  OR SEVERAL MILES LONG  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL KNOWN  BUTTHIS WAS NO CANYON  FROM BEGINNING TO END THE LENGTH OF THE STREAM WASNO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED YARDS  THREE HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE THE HOLE THESTREAM TOOK ITS RISE IN A SPRING AT THE FOOT OF A FLAT MEADOW  A HUNDREDYARDS BELOW THE HOLE THE STREAM RAN OUT INTO OPEN COUNTRY  JOINING THEMAIN STREAM AND FLOWING ACROSS ROLLING AND GRASS COVERED LAND MY COMPANION TOOK A TURN OF THE ROPE AROUND A TREE  AND WITH ME FAST ONTHE OTHER END LOWERED AWAY  IN NO TIME I WAS ON THE BOTTOM  AND IN BUTA SHORT WHILE HE HAD CARRIED ALL THE ARTICLES FROM THE CACHE AND LOWEREDTHEM DOWN TO ME  HE HAULED THE ROPE UP AND HID IT  AND BEFORE HE WENTAWAY CALLED DOWN TO ME A CHEERFUL PARTING BEFORE I GO ON I WANT TO SAY A WORD FOR THIS COMRADE  JOHN CARLSON  AHUMBLE FIGURE OF THE REVOLUTION  ONE OF THE COUNTLESS FAITHFUL ONES INTHE RANKS  HE WORKED FOR WICKSON  IN THE STABLES NEAR THE HUNTING LODGE IN FACT  IT WAS ON WICKSON S HORSES THAT WE HAD RIDDEN OVER SONOMAMOUNTAIN  FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS NOW JOHN CARLSON HAS BEEN CUSTODIANOF THE REFUGE  NO THOUGHT OF DISLOYALTY  I AM SURE  HAS EVER ENTERED HISMIND DURING ALL THAT TIME  TO BETRAY HIS TRUST WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HISMIND A THING UNDREAMED  HE WAS PHLEGMATIC  STOLID TO SUCH A DEGREE THATONE COULD NOT BUT WONDER HOW THE REVOLUTION HAD ANY MEANING TO HIM ATALL  AND YET LOVE OF FREEDOM GLOWED SOMBRELY AND STEADILY IN HISDIM SOUL  IN WAYS IT WAS INDEED GOOD THAT HE WAS NOT FLIGHTY ANDIMAGINATIVE  HE NEVER LOST HIS HEAD  HE COULD OBEY ORDERS  AND HE WASNEITHER CURIOUS NOR GARRULOUS  ONCE I ASKED HOW IT WAS THAT HE WAS AREVOLUTIONIST  WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I WAS A SOLDIER   WAS HIS ANSWER   IT WAS INGERMANY  THERE ALL YOUNG MEN MUST BE IN THE ARMY  SO I WAS IN THE ARMY THERE WAS ANOTHER SOLDIER THERE  A YOUNG MAN  TOO  HIS FATHER WAS WHATYOU CALL AN AGITATOR  AND HIS FATHER WAS IN JAIL FOR LESE MAJESTY  WHATYOU CALL SPEAKING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE EMPEROR  AND THE YOUNG MAN  THESON  TALKED WITH ME MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE  AND WORK  AND THE ROBBERY OFTHE PEOPLE BY THE CAPITALISTS  HE MADE ME SEE THINGS IN NEW WAYS  ANDI BECAME A SOCIALIST  HIS TALK WAS VERY TRUE AND GOOD  AND I HAVE NEVERFORGOTTEN  WHEN I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES I HUNTED UP THE SOCIALISTS I BECAME A MEMBER OF A SECTION  THAT WAS IN THE DAY OF THE S  L  P THEN LATER  WHEN THE SPLIT CAME  I JOINED THE LOCAL OF THE S  P  I WASWORKING IN A LIVERY STABLE IN SAN FRANCISCO THEN  THAT WAS BEFORE THEEARTHQUAKE  I HAVE PAID MY DUES FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS  I AM YET A MEMBER AND I YET PAY MY DUES  THOUGH IT IS VERY SECRET NOW  I WILL ALWAYS PAYMY DUES  AND WHEN THE COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH COMES  I WILL BE GLAD  LEFT TO MYSELF  I PROCEEDED TO COOK BREAKFAST ON THE OIL STOVE AND TOPREPARE MY HOME  OFTEN  IN THE EARLY MORNING  OR IN THE EVENING AFTERDARK  CARLSON WOULD STEAL DOWN TO THE REFUGE AND WORK FOR A COUPLE OFHOURS  AT FIRST MY HOME WAS THE TARPAULIN  LATER  A SMALL TENT WAS PUTUP  AND STILL LATER  WHEN WE BECAME ASSURED OF THE PERFECT SECURITY OFTHE PLACE  A SMALL HOUSE WAS ERECTED  THIS HOUSE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDENFROM ANY CHANCE EYE THAT MIGHT PEER DOWN FROM THE EDGE OF THE HOLE  THELUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD  ALSO  THEHOUSE WAS BUILT AGAINST THE PERPENDICULAR WALL  AND IN THE WALL ITSELF SHORED BY STRONG TIMBERS  WELL DRAINED AND VENTILATED  WE EXCAVATED TWOSMALL ROOMS  OH  BELIEVE ME  WE HAD MANY COMFORTS  WHEN BIEDENBACH THE GERMAN TERRORIST  HID WITH US SOME TIME LATER  HE INSTALLED ASMOKE CONSUMING DEVICE THAT ENABLED US TO SIT BY CRACKLING WOOD FIRES ONWINTER NIGHTS AND HERE I MUST SAY A WORD FOR THAT GENTLE SOULED TERRORIST  THAN WHOMTHERE IS NO COMRADE IN THE REVOLUTION MORE FEARFULLY MISUNDERSTOOD COMRADE BIEDENBACH DID NOT BETRAY THE CAUSE  NOR WAS HE EXECUTED BYTHE COMRADES AS IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED  THIS CANARD WAS CIRCULATED BYTHE CREATURES OF THE OLIGARCHY  COMRADE BIEDENBACH WAS ABSENT MINDED FORGETFUL  HE WAS SHOT BY ONE OF OUR LOOKOUTS AT THE CAVE REFUGE ATCARMEL  THROUGH FAILURE ON HIS PART TO REMEMBER THE SECRET SIGNALS  ITWAS ALL A SAD MISTAKE  AND THAT HE BETRAYED HIS FIGHTING GROUP IS ANABSOLUTE LIE  NO TRUER  MORE LOYAL MAN EVER LABORED FOR THE CAUSE         SEARCH AS WE MAY THROUGH ALL THE MATERIAL OF THOSE TIMES     THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US  WE CAN FIND NO CLEW TO THE     BIEDENBACH HERE REFERRED TO   NO MENTION IS MADE OF HIM     ANYWHERE SAVE IN THE EVERHARD MANUSCRIPT            FOR NINETEEN YEARS NOW THE REFUGE THAT I SELECTED HAD BEEN ALMOST     CONTINUOUSLY OCCUPIED  AND IN ALL THAT TIME  WITH ONE EXCEPTION  IT     HAS NEVER BEEN DISCOVERED BY AN OUTSIDER   AND YET IT WAS ONLY A     QUARTER OF A MILE FROM WICKSON S HUNTING LODGE  AND A SHORT MILE     FROM THE VILLAGE OF GLEN ELLEN   I WAS ABLE  ALWAYS  TO HEAR THE     MORNING AND EVENING TRAINS ARRIVE AND DEPART  AND I USED TO SET MY     WATCH BY THE WHISTLE AT THE BRICKYARDS         IF THE CURIOUS TRAVELLER WILL TURN SOUTH FROM GLEN ELLEN      HE WILL FIND HIMSELF ON A BOULEVARD THAT IS IDENTICAL WITH     THE OLD COUNTRY ROAD SEVEN CENTURIES AGO   A QUARTER OF A     MILE FROM GLEN ELLEN  AFTER THE SECOND BRIDGE IS PASSED  TO     THE RIGHT WILL BE NOTICED A BARRANCA THAT RUNS LIKE A SCAR     ACROSS THE ROLLING LAND TOWARD A GROUP OF WOODED KNOLLS      THE BARRANCA IS THE SITE OF THE ANCIENT RIGHT OF WAY THAT IN     THE TIME OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND RAN ACROSS THE HOLDING     OF ONE CHAUVET  A FRENCH PIONEER OF CALIFORNIA WHO CAME FROM     HIS NATIVE COUNTRY IN THE FABLED DAYS OF GOLD   THE WOODED     KNOLLS ARE THE SAME KNOLLS REFERRED TO BY AVIS EVERHARD      THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF      A D  BROKE OFF THE SIDE OF ONE     OF THESE KNOLLS AND TOPPLED IT INTO THE HOLE WHERE THE     EVERHARDS MADE THEIR REFUGE   SINCE THE FINDING OF THE     MANUSCRIPT EXCAVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE  AND THE HOUSE  THE     TWO CAVE ROOMS  AND ALL THE ACCUMULATED RUBBISH OF LONG     OCCUPANCY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT  MANY VALUABLE RELICS     HAVE BEEN FOUND  AMONG WHICH  CURIOUS TO RELATE  IS THE     SMOKE CONSUMING DEVICE OF BIEDENBACH S MENTIONED IN THE     NARRATIVE   STUDENTS INTERESTED IN SUCH MATTERS SHOULD READ     THE BROCHURE OF ARNOLD BENTHAM SOON TO BE PUBLISHED      A MILE NORTHWEST FROM THE WOODED KNOLLS BRINGS ONE TO THE     SITE OF WAKE ROBIN LODGE AT THE JUNCTION OF WILD WATER AND     SONOMA CREEKS  IT MAY BE NOTICED  IN PASSING  THAT WILD      WATER WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED GRAHAM CREEK AND WAS SO NAMED ON     THE EARLY LOCAL MAPS   BUT THE LATER NAME STICKS   IT WAS AT     WAKE ROBIN LODGE THAT AVIS EVERHARD LATER LIVED FOR SHORT     PERIODS  WHEN  DISGUISED AS AN AGENT PROVOCATEUR OF THE IRON     HEEL  SHE WAS ENABLED TO PLAY WITH IMPUNITY HER

PRACTISED FOR HOURS IN BURYINGFOREVER THE OLD AVIS EVERHARD BENEATH THE SKIN OF ANOTHER WOMAN WHOM IMAY CALL MY OTHER SELF  IT WAS ONLY BY LONG PRACTICE THAT SUCH RESULTSCOULD BE OBTAINED  IN THE MERE DETAIL OF VOICE INTONATION I PRACTISEDALMOST PERPETUALLY TILL THE VOICE OF MY NEW SELF BECAME FIXED AUTOMATIC  IT WAS THIS AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION OF A ROLE THAT WASCONSIDERED IMPERATIVE  ONE MUST BECOME SO ADEPT AS TO DECEIVE ONESELF IT WAS LIKE LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE  SAY THE FRENCH  AT FIRST SPEECH INFRENCH IS SELF CONSCIOUS  A MATTER OF THE WILL  THE STUDENT THINKSIN ENGLISH AND THEN TRANSMUTES INTO FRENCH  OR READS IN FRENCH BUTTRANSMUTES INTO ENGLISH BEFORE HE CAN UNDERSTAND  THEN LATER  BECOMINGFIRMLY GROUNDED  AUTOMATIC  THE STUDENT READS  WRITES  AND THINKS INFRENCH  WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE TO ENGLISH AT ALL AND SO WITH OUR DISGUISES  IT WAS NECESSARY FOR US TO PRACTISE UNTIL OURASSUMED ROLES BECAME REAL  UNTIL TO BE OUR ORIGINAL SELVES WOULD REQUIREA WATCHFUL AND STRONG EXERCISE OF WILL  OF COURSE  AT FIRST  MUCH WASMERE BLUNDERING EXPERIMENT  WE WERE CREATING A NEW ART  AND WE HAD MUCHTO DISCOVER  BUT THE WORK WAS GOING ON EVERYWHERE  MASTERS IN THEART WERE DEVELOPING  AND A FUND OF TRICKS AND EXPEDIENTS WAS BEINGACCUMULATED  THIS FUND BECAME A SORT OF TEXT BOOK THAT WAS PASSED ON  APART OF THE CURRICULUM  AS IT WERE  OF THE SCHOOL OF REVOLUTION         DISGUISE DID BECOME A VERITABLE ART DURING THAT PERIOD      THE REVOLUTIONISTS MAINTAINED SCHOOLS OF ACTING IN ALL THEIR     REFUGES  THEY SCORNED ACCESSORIES  SUCH AS WIGS AND BEARDS      FALSE EYEBROWS  AND SUCH AIDS OF THE THEATRICAL ACTORS   THE     GAME OF REVOLUTION WAS A GAME OF LIFE AND DEATH  AND MERE     ACCESSORIES WERE TRAPS  DISGUISE HAD TO BE FUNDAMENTAL      INTRINSIC  PART AND PARCEL OF ONE S BEING  SECOND NATURE      THE RED VIRGIN IS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MOST     ADEPT IN THE ART  TO WHICH MUST BE ASCRIBED HER LONG AND     SUCCESSFUL CAREER IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT MY FATHER DISAPPEARED  HIS LETTERS  WHICH HADCOME TO ME REGULARLY  CEASED  HE NO LONGER APPEARED AT OUR PELL STREETQUARTERS  OUR COMRADES SOUGHT HIM EVERYWHERE  THROUGH OUR SECRET SERVICEWE RANSACKED EVERY PRISON IN THE LAND  BUT HE WAS LOST AS COMPLETELY ASIF THE EARTH HAD SWALLOWED HIM UP  AND TO THIS DAY NO CLEW TO HIS ENDHAS BEEN DISCOVERED         DISAPPEARANCE WAS ONE OF THE HORRORS OF THE TIME   AS A     MOTIF  IN SONG AND STORY  IT CONSTANTLY CROPS UP   IT WAS AN     INEVITABLE CONCOMITANT OF THE SUBTERRANEAN WARFARE THAT     RAGED THROUGH THOSE THREE CENTURIES   THIS PHENOMENON WAS     ALMOST AS COMMON IN THE OLIGARCH CLASS AND THE LABOR CASTES      AS IT WAS IN THE RANKS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS   WITHOUT     WARNING  WITHOUT TRACE  MEN AND WOMEN  AND EVEN CHILDREN      DISAPPEARED AND WERE SEEN NO MORE  THEIR END SHROUDED IN     MYSTERY SIX LONELY MONTHS I SPENT IN THE REFUGE  BUT THEY WERE NOT IDLE MONTHS OUR ORGANIZATION WENT ON APACE  AND THERE WERE MOUNTAINS OF WORK ALWAYSWAITING TO BE DONE  ERNEST AND HIS FELLOW LEADERS  FROM THEIR PRISONS DECIDED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE  AND IT REMAINED FOR US ON THE OUTSIDE TODO IT  THERE WAS THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MOUTH

KNITTING TOGETHER OF ALL OURMYRIADS OF PLACES OF REFUGE  AND THE FORMATION OF NEW REFUGES WHERELINKS WERE MISSING IN THE CHAINS WE RAN OVER ALL THE LAND SO I SAY  THE WORK WAS NEVER DONE  AT THE END

HIS ARM IN THE SIERRA MILLS AND WHO HAD BEEN THECAUSE OF MY OWN CONVERSION INTO A REVOLUTIONIST  I NEVER SAW AGAIN BUT WE ALL KNEW WHAT HE DID BEFORE HE DIED  HE NEVER JOINED THEREVOLUTIONISTS  EMBITTERED BY HIS FATE  BROODING OVER HIS WRONGS  HEBECAME AN ANARCHIST  NOT A PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHIST  BUT A MERE ANIMAL  MADWITH HATE AND LUST FOR REVENGE  AND WELL HE REVENGED HIMSELF  EVADINGTHE GUARDS  IN THE NIGHTTIME WHILE ALL WERE ASLEEP  HE BLEW THEPERTONWAITHE PALACE INTO ATOMS  NOT A SOUL ESCAPED  NOT EVEN THE GUARDS AND IN PRISON  WHILE AWAITING TRIAL  HE SUFFOCATED HIMSELF UNDER HISBLANKETS DR  HAMMERFIELD AND DR  BALLINGFORD ACHIEVED QUITE DIFFERENT FATES FROMTHAT OF JACKSON  THEY HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TO THEIR SALT  AND THEY HAVEBEEN CORRESPONDINGLY REWARDED WITH ECCLESIASTICAL PALACES WHEREIN THEYDWELL AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD  BOTH ARE APOLOGISTS FOR THE OLIGARCHY BOTH HAVE GROWN VERY FAT   DR  HAMMERFIELD   AS ERNEST ONCE SAID   HASSUCCEEDED IN MODIFYING HIS METAPHYSICS SO AS TO GIVE GOD S SANCTION TOTHE IRON HEEL  AND ALSO TO INCLUDE MUCH WORSHIP OF BEAUTY AND TO REDUCETO AN INVISIBLE WRAITH THE GASEOUS VERTEBRATE DESCRIBED BY HAECKEL  THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN DR  HAMMERFIELD AND DR  BALLINGFORD BEING THAT THELATTER HAS MADE THE GOD OF THE OLIGARCHS A LITTLE MORE GASEOUS AND ALITTLE LESS VERTEBRATE  PETER DONNELLY  THE SCAB FOREMAN AT THE SIERRA MILLS WHOM I ENCOUNTEREDWHILE INVESTIGATING THE CASE OF JACKSON  WAS A SURPRISE TO ALL OF US  IN     I WAS PRESENT AT A MEETING OF THE  FRISCO REDS  OF ALL OUR FIGHTINGGROUPS THIS ONE WAS THE MOST FORMIDABLE  FEROCIOUS  AND MERCILESS  ITWAS REALLY NOT A PART OF OUR ORGANIZATION  ITS MEMBERS WERE FANATICS MADMEN  WE DARED NOT ENCOURAGE SUCH A SPIRIT  ON THE OTHER HAND  THOUGHTHEY DID NOT BELONG TO US  WE REMAINED ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THEM  ITWAS A MATTER OF VITAL IMPORTANCE THAT BROUGHT ME THERE THAT NIGHT  I ALONE IN THE MIDST OF A SCORE OF MEN  WAS THE ONLY PERSON UNMASKED AFTER THE BUSINESS THAT BROUGHT ME THERE WAS TRANSACTED  I WAS LEDAWAY BY ONE OF THEM  IN A DARK PASSAGE THIS GUIDE STRUCK A MATCH  AND HOLDING IT CLOSE TO HIS FACE  SLIPPED BACK HIS MASK  FOR A MOMENT IGAZED

NOW  AND I LL GET YOU OUT OF THIS  MORE I HEARD OF HIM AFTERWARD  IN HIS OWN WAY HE HAD TOLD THE TRUTHWHEN HE SAID ALL WERE DEAD  BUT ONE LIVED  TIMOTHY  AND HIM HIS FATHERCONSIDERED DEAD BECAUSE HE HAD TAKEN SERVICE WITH THE IRON HEEL IN THEMERCENARIES   A MEMBER OF THE  FRISCO REDS PLEDGED HIMSELF TO TWELVEANNUAL EXECUTIONS  THE PENALTY FOR FAILURE WAS DEATH  A MEMBER WHOFAILED TO COMPLETE HIS NUMBER COMMITTED SUICIDE  THESE EXECUTIONS WERENOT HAPHAZARD  THIS GROUP OF MADMEN MET FREQUENTLY AND PASSED WHOLESALEJUDGMENTS UPON OFFENDING MEMBERS AND SERVITORS OF THE OLIGARCHY  THEEXECUTIONS WERE AFTERWARD APPORTIONED BY LOT        IN ADDITION TO THE LABOR CASTES  THERE AROSE ANOTHER     CASTE  THE MILITARY   A STANDING ARMY OF PROFESSIONAL     SOLDIERS WAS CREATED  OFFICERED BY MEMBERS OF THE OLIGARCHY     AND KNOWN AS THE MERCENARIES  THIS INSTITUTION TOOK THE     PLACE OF THE MILITIA  WHICH HAD PROVED IMPRACTICABLE UNDER     THE NEW REGIME   OUTSIDE THE REGULAR SECRET SERVICE OF THE     IRON HEEL  THERE WAS FURTHER ESTABLISHED A SECRET SERVICE OF     THE MERCENARIES  THIS LATTER FORMING A CONNECTING LINK     BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE MILITARY IN FACT  THE BUSINESS THAT BROUGHT ME THERE THE NIGHT OF MY VISIT WASSUCH A TRIAL  ONE OF OUR OWN COMRADES  WHO FOR YEARS HAD SUCCESSFULLYMAINTAINED HIMSELF IN A CLERICAL POSITION IN THE LOCAL BUREAU OF THESECRET SERVICE OF THE IRON HEEL  HAD FALLEN UNDER THE BAN OF THE  FRISCOREDS AND WAS BEING TRIED  OF COURSE HE WAS NOT PRESENT  AND OF COURSEHIS JUDGES DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS ONE OF OUR MEN  MY MISSION HAD BEENTO TESTIFY TO HIS IDENTITY AND LOYALTY  IT MAY BE WONDERED HOW WE CAMETO KNOW OF THE AFFAIR AT ALL  THE EXPLANATION IS SIMPLE  ONE OF OURSECRET AGENTS WAS A MEMBER OF THE  FRISCO REDS  IT WAS NECESSARY FOR USTO KEEP AN EYE ON FRIEND AS WELL AS FOE  AND THIS GROUP OF MADMEN WASNOT TOO UNIMPORTANT TO ESCAPE OUR SURVEILLANCE BUT TO RETURN TO PETER DONNELLY AND HIS SON  ALL WENT WELL WITH DONNELLYUNTIL  IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR  HE FOUND AMONG THE SHEAF OF EXECUTIONSTHAT FELL TO HIM THE NAME OF TIMOTHY DONNELLY  THEN IT WAS THAT THATCLANNISHNESS  WHICH WAS HIS TO SO EXTRAORDINARY A DEGREE  ASSERTEDITSELF  TO SAVE HIS SON  HE BETRAYED HIS COMRADES  IN THIS HE WASPARTIALLY BLOCKED  BUT A DOZEN OF THE  FRISCO REDS WERE EXECUTED  ANDTHE GROUP WAS WELL NIGH DESTROYED  IN RETALIATION  THE SURVIVORS METEDOUT TO DONNELLY THE DEATH HE HAD EARNED BY HIS TREASON NOR DID TIMOTHY DONNELLY LONG SURVIVE  THE  FRISCO REDS PLEDGEDTHEMSELVES TO HIS EXECUTION  EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE BY THE OLIGARCHY TOSAVE HIM  HE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER THREE OF THE REDS LOST THEIR LIVES IN VAIN EFFORTS TO GET HIM  THE GROUPWAS COMPOSED ONLY OF MEN  IN THE END THEY FELL BACK ON A WOMAN  ONEOF OUR COMRADES  AND NONE OTHER THAN ANNA ROYLSTON  OUR INNERCIRCLE FORBADE HER  BUT SHE HAD EVER A WILL OF HER OWN AND DISDAINEDDISCIPLINE  FURTHERMORE  SHE WAS A GENIUS AND LOVABLE  AND WE COULDNEVER DISCIPLINE HER ANYWAY  SHE IS IN A CLASS BY HERSELF AND NOTAMENABLE TO THE ORDINARY STANDARDS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS DESPITE OUR REFUSAL TO GRANT PERMISSION TO DO THE DEED  SHE WENT ON WITHIT  NOW ANNA ROYLSTON WAS A FASCINATING WOMAN  ALL SHE HAD TO DO WASTO BECKON A MAN TO HER  SHE BROKE THE HEARTS OF SCORES OF OUR YOUNGCOMRADES  AND SCORES OF OTHERS SHE CAPTURED  AND BY THEIR HEART STRINGSLED INTO OUR ORGANIZATION  YET SHE STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO MARRY  SHEDEARLY LOVED CHILDREN  BUT SHE HELD THAT A CHILD OF HER OWN WOULD CLAIMHER FROM THE CAUSE  AND THAT IT WAS THE CAUSE TO WHICH HER LIFE WASDEVOTED IT WAS AN EASY TASK FOR ANNA ROYLSTON TO WIN TIMOTHY DONNELLY  HERCONSCIENCE DID NOT TROUBLE HER  FOR AT THAT VERY TIME OCCURRED THENASHVILLE MASSACRE  WHEN THE MERCENARIES  DONNELLY IN COMMAND  LITERALLYMURDERED EIGHT HUNDRED WEAVERS OF THAT CITY  BUT SHE DID NOT KILLDONNELLY  SHE TURNED HIM OVER  A PRISONER  TO THE  FRISCO REDS THIS HAPPENED ONLY LAST YEAR  AND NOW SHE HAD BEEN RENAMED  THEREVOLUTIONISTS EVERYWHERE ARE CALLING HER THE  RED VIRGIN          IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SECOND REVOLT WAS CRUSHED  THAT THE      FRISCO REDS FLOURISHED AGAIN   AND FOR TWO GENERATIONS THE     GROUP FLOURISHED   THEN AN AGENT OF THE IRON HEEL MANAGED TO     BECOME A MEMBER  PENETRATED ALL ITS SECRETS  AND BROUGHT     ABOUT ITS TOTAL ANNIHILATION   THIS OCCURRED IN      A D      THE MEMBERS WERE EXECUTED ONE AT A TIME  AT INTERVALS OF     THREE WEEKS  AND THEIR BODIES EXPOSED IN THE LABOR GHETTO OF     SAN FRANCISCO COLONEL INGRAM AND COLONEL VAN GILBERT ARE TWO MORE FAMILIAR FIGURESTHAT I WAS LATER TO ENCOUNTER  COLONEL INGRAM ROSE HIGH IN THE OLIGARCHYAND BECAME MINISTER TO GERMANY  HE WAS CORDIALLY DETESTED BY THEPROLETARIAT OF BOTH COUNTRIES  IT WAS IN BERLIN THAT I MET HIM  WHERE AS AN ACCREDITED INTERNATIONAL SPY OF THE IRON HEEL  I WAS RECEIVED BYHIM AND AFFORDED MUCH ASSISTANCE  INCIDENTALLY  I MAY STATE THAT IN MYDUAL ROLE I MANAGED A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS FOR THE REVOLUTION COLONEL VAN GILBERT BECAME KNOWN AS  SNARLING  VAN GILBERT  HISIMPORTANT PART WAS PLAYED IN DRAFTING THE NEW CODE AFTER THE CHICAGOCOMMUNE  BUT BEFORE THAT  AS TRIAL JUDGE  HE HAD EARNED SENTENCE OFDEATH BY HIS FIENDISH MALIGNANCY  I WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT TRIED HIM ANDPASSED SENTENCE UPON HIM  ANNA ROYLSTON CARRIED OUT THE EXECUTION STILL ANOTHER FIGURE ARISES OUT OF THE OLD LIFE  JACKSON S LAWYER  LEASTOF ALL WOULD I HAVE EXPECTED AGAIN TO MEET THIS MAN  JOSEPH HURD  IT WASA STRANGE MEETING  LATE AT NIGHT  TWO YEARS AFTER THE CHICAGO COMMUNE ERNEST AND I ARRIVED TOGETHER AT THE BENTON HARBOR REFUGE  THIS WASIN MICHIGAN  ACROSS THE LAKE FROM CHICAGO  WE ARRIVED JUST AT THECONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL OF A SPY  SENTENCE OF DEATH HAD BEEN PASSED  ANDHE WAS BEING LED AWAY  SUCH WAS THE SCENE AS WE CAME UPON IT  THE NEXTMOMENT THE WRETCHED MAN HAD WRENCHED FREE FROM HIS CAPTORS AND FLUNGHIMSELF AT MY FEET  HIS ARMS CLUTCHING ME ABOUT THE KNEES IN A VICELIKEGRIP AS HE PRAYED IN A FRENZY FOR MERCY  AS HE TURNED HIS AGONIZED FACEUP TO ME  I RECOGNIZED HIM AS JOSEPH HURD  OF ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGSI HAVE WITNESSED  NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO UNNERVED AS BY THIS FRANTICCREATURE S PLEADING FOR LIFE  HE WAS MAD FOR LIFE  IT WAS PITIABLE  HEREFUSED TO LET GO OF ME  DESPITE THE HANDS OF A DOZEN COMRADES  AND WHENAT LAST HE WAS DRAGGED SHRIEKING AWAY  I SANK DOWN FAINTING UPON THEFLOOR  IT IS FAR EASIER TO SEE BRAVE MEN DIE THAN TO HEAR A COWARD BEGFOR LIFE         THE BENTON HARBOR REFUGE WAS A CATACOMB  THE ENTRANCE OF     WHICH WAS CUNNINGLY CONTRIVED BY WAY OF A WELL   IT HAS BEEN     MAINTAINED IN A FAIR STATE OF PRESERVATION  AND THE CURIOUS     VISITOR MAY TO DAY TREAD ITS LABYRINTHS TO THE ASSEMBLY     HALL  WHERE  WITHOUT DOUBT  OCCURRED THE SCENE DESCRIBED BY     AVIS EVERHARD   FARTHER ON ARE THE CELLS WHERE THE PRISONERS     WERE CONFINED  AND THE DEATH CHAMBER WHERE THE EXECUTIONS     TOOK PLACE   BEYOND IS THE CEMETERY  LONG  WINDING GALLERIES     HEWN OUT OF THE SOLID ROCK  WITH RECESSES ON EITHER HAND      WHEREIN  TIER ABOVE TIER  LIE THE REVOLUTIONISTS JUST AS     THEY WERE LAID AWAY BY THEIR COMRADES LONG YEARS AGONE CHAPTER XXA LOST OLIGARCHBUT IN REMEMBERING THE OLD LIFE I HAVE RUN AHEAD OF MY STORY INTO THENEW LIFE  THE WHOLESALE JAIL DELIVERY DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL WELL ALONGINTO       COMPLICATED AS IT WAS  IT WAS CARRIED THROUGH WITHOUT AHITCH  AND AS A VERY CREDITABLE ACHIEVEMENT IT CHEERED US ON IN OURWORK  FROM CUBA TO CALIFORNIA  OUT OF SCORES OF JAILS  MILITARY PRISONS AND FORTRESSES  IN A SINGLE NIGHT  WE DELIVERED FIFTY ONE OF OURFIFTY TWO CONGRESSMEN  AND IN ADDITION OVER THREE HUNDRED OTHER LEADERS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE INSTANCE OF MISCARRIAGE  NOT ONLY DID THEYESCAPE  BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM WON TO THE REFUGES AS PLANNED  THE ONECOMRADE CONGRESSMAN WE DID NOT GET WAS ARTHUR SIMPSON  AND HE HADALREADY DIED IN CABANAS AFTER CRUEL TORTURES THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED WAS PERHAPS THE HAPPIEST OF MY LIFEWITH ERNEST  DURING THAT TIME WE WERE NEVER APART  LATER  WHEN WE WENTBACK INTO THE WORLD  WE WERE SEPARATED MUCH  NOT MORE IMPATIENTLY DO IAWAIT THE FLAME OF TO MORROW S REVOLT THAN DID I THAT NIGHT AWAIT THECOMING OF ERNEST  I HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR SO LONG  AND THE THOUGHT OF APOSSIBLE HITCH OR ERROR IN OUR PLANS THAT WOULD KEEP HIM STILL IN HISISLAND PRISON ALMOST DROVE ME MAD  THE HOURS PASSED LIKE AGES  I WASALL ALONE  BIEDENBACH  AND THREE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN THEREFUGE  WERE OUT AND OVER THE MOUNTAIN  HEAVILY ARMED AND PREPARED FORANYTHING  THE REFUGES ALL OVER THE LAND WERE QUITE EMPTY  I IMAGINE  OFCOMRADES THAT NIGHT JUST AS THE SKY PALED WITH THE FIRST WARNING OF DAWN  I HEARD THESIGNAL FROM ABOVE AND GAVE THE ANSWER  IN THE DARKNESS I ALMOST EMBRACEDBIEDENBACH  WHO CAME DOWN FIRST  BUT THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS IN ERNEST SARMS  AND IN THAT MOMENT  SO COMPLETE HAD BEEN MY TRANSFORMATION  IDISCOVERED IT WAS ONLY BY AN EFFORT OF WILL THAT I COULD BE THE OLD AVISEVERHARD  WITH THE OLD MANNERISMS AND SMILES  PHRASES AND INTONATIONS OFVOICE  IT WAS BY STRONG EFFORT ONLY THAT I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN MYOLD IDENTITY  I COULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO FORGET FOR AN INSTANT  SOAUTOMATICALLY IMPERATIVE HAD BECOME THE NEW PERSONALITY I HAD CREATED ONCE INSIDE THE LITTLE CABIN  I SAW ERNEST S FACE IN THE LIGHT  WITH THEEXCEPTION OF THE PRISON PALLOR  THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN HIM  AT LEAST NOT MUCH  HE WAS MY SAME LOVER HUSBAND AND HERO  AND YET THERE WAS ACERTAIN ASCETIC LENGTHENING OF THE LINES OF HIS FACE  BUT HE COULD WELLSTAND IT  FOR IT SEEMED TO ADD A CERTAIN NOBILITY OF REFINEMENT TO THERIOTOUS EXCESS OF LIFE THAT HAD ALWAYS MARKED HIS FEATURES  HE MIGHTHAVE BEEN A TRIFLE GRAVER THAN OF YORE  BUT THE GLINT OF LAUGHTER STILLWAS IN HIS EYES  HE WAS TWENTY POUNDS LIGHTER  BUT IN SPLENDIDPHYSICAL CONDITION  HE HAD KEPT UP EXERCISE DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OFCONFINEMENT  AND HIS MUSCLES WERE LIKE IRON  IN TRUTH  HE WAS IN BETTERCONDITION THAN WHEN HE HAD ENTERED PRISON  HOURS PASSED BEFORE HIS HEADTOUCHED PILLOW AND I HAD SOOTHED HIM OFF TO SLEEP  BUT THERE WAS NOSLEEP FOR ME  I WAS TOO HAPPY  AND THE FATIGUE OF JAIL BREAKING ANDRIDING HORSEBACK HAD NOT BEEN MINE WHILE ERNEST SLEPT  I CHANGED MY DRESS  ARRANGED MY HAIR DIFFERENTLY AND CAME BACK TO MY NEW AUTOMATIC SELF  THEN  WHEN BIEDENBACH AND THEOTHER COMRADES AWOKE  WITH THEIR AID I CONCOCTED A LITTLE CONSPIRACY ALL WAS READY  AND WE WERE IN THE CAVE ROOM THAT SERVED FOR KITCHENAND DINING ROOM WHEN ERNEST OPENED THE DOOR AND ENTERED  AT THAT MOMENTBIEDENBACH ADDRESSED ME AS MARY  AND I TURNED AND ANSWERED HIM  THEN IGLANCED AT ERNEST WITH CURIOUS INTEREST  SUCH AS ANY YOUNG COMRADE MIGHTBETRAY ON SEEING FOR THE FIRST TIME SO NOTED A HERO OF THE REVOLUTION BUT ERNEST S GLANCE TOOK ME IN AND QUESTIONED IMPATIENTLY PAST ANDAROUND THE ROOM  THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS BEING INTRODUCED TO HIM AS MARYHOLMES TO COMPLETE THE DECEPTION  AN EXTRA PLATE WAS LAID  AND WHEN WE SAT DOWNTO TABLE ONE CHAIR WAS NOT OCCUPIED  I COULD HAVE CRIED WITH JOY AS INOTED ERNEST S INCREASING UNEASINESS AND IMPATIENCE  FINALLY HE COULDSTAND IT NO LONGER  WHERE S MY WIFE   HE DEMANDED BLUNTLY  SHE IS STILL ASLEEP   I ANSWERED IT WAS THE CRUCIAL MOMENT  BUT MY VOICE WAS A STRANGE VOICE  AND IN ITHE RECOGNIZED NOTHING FAMILIAR  THE MEAL WENT ON  I TALKED A GREATDEAL  AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY  AS A HERO WORSHIPPER MIGHT TALK  AND ITWAS OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS MY HERO  I ROSE TO A CLIMAX OF ENTHUSIASM ANDWORSHIP  AND  BEFORE HE COULD GUESS MY INTENTION  THREW MY ARMS AROUNDHIS NECK AND KISSED HIM ON THE LIPS  HE HELD ME FROM HIM AT ARM S LENGTHAND STARED ABOUT IN ANNOYANCE AND PERPLEXITY  THE FOUR MEN GREETED HIMWITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER  AND EXPLANATIONS WERE MADE  AT FIRST HE WASSCEPTICAL  HE SCRUTINIZED ME KEENLY AND WAS HALF CONVINCED  THEN SHOOKHIS HEAD AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE  IT WAS NOT UNTIL I BECAME THE OLD AVISEVERHARD AND WHISPERED SECRETS IN HIS EAR THAT NONE KNEW BUT HE AND AVISEVERHARD  THAT HE ACCEPTED ME AS HIS REALLY  TRULY WIFE IT WAS LATER IN THE DAY THAT HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS  MANIFESTING GREATEMBARRASSMENT AND CLAIMING POLYGAMOUS EMOTIONS  YOU ARE MY AVIS   HE SAID   AND YOU ARE ALSO SOME ONE ELSE  YOU ARE TWOWOMEN  AND THEREFORE YOU ARE MY HAREM  AT ANY RATE  WE ARE SAFE NOW IF THE UNITED STATES BECOMES TOO HOT FOR US  WHY I HAVE QUALIFIED FORCITIZENSHIP IN TURKEY          AT THAT TIME POLYGAMY WAS STILL PRACTISED IN TURKEY LIFE BECAME FOR ME VERY HAPPY IN THE REFUGE  IT IS TRUE  WE WORKEDHARD AND FOR LONG HOURS  BUT WE WORKED TOGETHER  WE HAD EACH OTHER FOREIGHTEEN PRECIOUS MONTHS  AND WE WERE NOT LONELY  FOR THERE WAS ALWAYSA COMING AND GOING OF LEADERS AND COMRADES  STRANGE VOICES FROM THEUNDER WORLD OF INTRIGUE AND REVOLUTION  BRINGING STRANGER TALES OFSTRIFE AND WAR FROM ALL OUR BATTLE LINE  AND THERE WAS MUCH FUN ANDDELIGHT  WE WERE NOT MERE GLOOMY CONSPIRATORS  WE TOILED HARD ANDSUFFERED GREATLY  FILLED THE GAPS IN OUR RANKS AND WENT ON  AND THROUGHALL THE LABOUR AND THE PLAY AND INTERPLAY OF LIFE AND DEATH WE FOUNDTIME TO LAUGH AND LOVE  THERE WERE ARTISTS  SCIENTISTS  SCHOLARS MUSICIANS  AND POETS AMONG US  AND IN THAT HOLE IN THE GROUND CULTUREWAS HIGHER AND FINER THAN IN THE PALACES OF WONDER CITIES OF THEOLIGARCHS  IN TRUTH  MANY OF OUR COMRADES TOILED AT MAKING BEAUTIFULTHOSE SAME PALACES AND WONDER CITIES         THIS IS NOT BRAGGADOCIO ON THE PART OF AVIS EVERHARD   THE     FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE     REVOLUTIONISTS   WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW OF THE     MUSICIANS AND SINGERS  AND OF A FEW OF THE OLIGARCHS  ALL     THE GREAT CREATORS OF THE PERIOD WHOSE NAMES HAVE COME DOWN     TO US  WERE REVOLUTIONISTS NOR WERE WE CONFINED TO THE REFUGE ITSELF  OFTEN AT NIGHT WE RODE OVERTHE MOUNTAINS FOR EXERCISE  AND WE RODE ON WICKSON S HORSES  IF ONLY HEKNEW HOW MANY REVOLUTIONISTS HIS HORSES HAVE CARRIED  WE EVEN WENT ONPICNICS TO ISOLATED SPOTS WE KNEW  WHERE WE REMAINED ALL DAY  GOINGBEFORE DAYLIGHT AND RETURNING AFTER DARK  ALSO  WE USED WICKSON S CREAMAND BUTTER   AND ERNEST WAS NOT ABOVE SHOOTING WICKSON S QUAIL ANDRABBITS  AND  ON OCCASION  HIS YOUNG BUCKS        EVEN AS LATE AS THAT PERIOD  CREAM AND BUTTER WERE STILL     CRUDELY EXTRACTED FROM COW S MILK   THE LABORATORY     PREPARATION OF FOODS HAD NOT YET BEGUN INDEED  IT WAS A SAFE REFUGE  I HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS DISCOVERED ONLYONCE  AND THIS BRINGS ME TO THE CLEARING UP OF THE MYSTERY OF THEDISAPPEARANCE OF YOUNG WICKSON  NOW THAT HE IS DEAD  I AM FREE TO SPEAK THERE WAS A NOOK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT HOLE WHERE THE SUN SHONE FORSEVERAL HOURS AND WHICH WAS HIDDEN FROM ABOVE  HERE WE HAD CARRIEDMANY LOADS OF GRAVEL FROM THE CREEK BED  SO THAT IT WAS DRY AND WARM A PLEASANT BASKING PLACE  AND HERE  ONE AFTERNOON  I WAS DROWSING  HALFASLEEP  OVER A VOLUME OF MENDENHALL   I WAS SO COMFORTABLE AND SECURETHAT EVEN HIS FLAMING LYRICS FAILED TO STIR ME        IN ALL THE EXTANT LITERATURE AND DOCUMENTS OF THAT PERIOD      CONTINUAL REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE POEMS OF RUDOLPH     MENDENHALL   BY HIS COMRADES HE WAS CALLED  THE FLAME    HE     WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A GREAT GENIUS  YET  BEYOND WEIRD AND     HAUNTING FRAGMENTS OF HIS VERSE  QUOTED IN THE WRITINGS OF     OTHERS  NOTHING OF HIS HAS COME DOWN TO US   HE WAS EXECUTED     BY THE IRON HEEL IN      A D I WAS AROUSED BY A CLOD OF EARTH STRIKING AT MY FEET  THEN FROM ABOVE I HEARD A SOUND OF SCRAMBLING  THE NEXT MOMENT A YOUNG MAN  WITH AFINAL SLIDE DOWN THE CRUMBLING WALL  ALIGHTED AT MY FEET  IT WAS PHILIPWICKSON  THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW HIM AT THE TIME  HE LOOKED AT ME COOLLYAND UTTERED A LOW WHISTLE OF SURPRISE  WELL   HE SAID  AND THE NEXT MOMENT  CAP IN HAND  HE WAS SAYING   I BEGYOUR PARDON  I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND ANY ONE HERE  I WAS NOT SO COOL  I WAS STILL A TYRO SO FAR AS CONCERNED KNOWING HOW TOBEHAVE IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES  LATER ON  WHEN I WAS AN INTERNATIONALSPY  I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LESS CLUMSY  I AM SURE  AS IT WAS  I SCRAMBLEDTO MY FEET AND CRIED OUT THE DANGER CALL  WHY DID YOU DO THAT   HE ASKED  LOOKING AT ME SEARCHINGLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD NO SUSPICION OF OUR PRESENCE WHEN MAKING THEDESCENT  I RECOGNIZED THIS WITH RELIEF  FOR WHAT PURPOSE DO YOU THINK I DID IT   I COUNTERED  I WAS INDEEDCLUMSY IN THOSE DAYS  I DON T KNOW   HE ANSWERED  SHAKING HIS HEAD   UNLESS YOU VE GOTFRIENDS ABOUT  ANYWAY  YOU VE GOT SOME EXPLANATIONS TO MAKE  I DON TLIKE THE LOOK OF IT  YOU ARE TRESPASSING  THIS IS MY FATHER S LAND AND   BUT AT THAT MOMENT  BIEDENBACH  EVERY POLITE AND GENTLE  SAID FROMBEHIND HIM IN A LOW VOICE   HANDS UP  MY YOUNG SIR  YOUNG WICKSON PUT HIS HANDS UP FIRST  THEN TURNED TO CONFRONTBIEDENBACH  WHO HELD A THIRTY THIRTY AUTOMATIC RIFLE ON HIM  WICKSON WASIMPERTURBABLE  OH  HO   HE SAID   A NEST OF REVOLUTIONISTS  AND QUITE A HORNET S NESTIT WOULD SEEM  WELL  YOU WON T ABIDE HERE LONG  I CAN TELL YOU   MAYBE YOU LL ABIDE HERE LONG ENOUGH TO RECONSIDER THAT STATEMENT  BIEDENBACH SAID QUIETLY   AND IN THE MEANWHILE I MUST ASK YOU TO COMEINSIDE WITH ME   INSIDE   THE YOUNG MAN WAS GENUINELY ASTONISHED   HAVE YOU A CATACOMBHERE  I HAVE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS   COME AND SEE   BIEDENBACH ANSWERED WITH HIS ADORABLE ACCENT  BUT IT IS UNLAWFUL   WAS THE PROTEST  YES  BY YOUR LAW   THE TERRORIST REPLIED SIGNIFICANTLY   BUT BY OURLAW  BELIEVE ME  IT IS QUITE LAWFUL  YOU MUST ACCUSTOM YOURSELF TOTHE FACT THAT YOU ARE IN ANOTHER WORLD THAN THE ONE OF OPPRESSION ANDBRUTALITY IN WHICH YOU HAVE LIVED   THERE IS ROOM FOR ARGUMENT THERE   WICKSON MUTTERED  THEN STAY WITH US AND DISCUSS IT  THE YOUNG FELLOW LAUGHED AND FOLLOWED HIS CAPTOR INTO THE HOUSE  HEWAS LED INTO THE INNER CAVE ROOM  AND ONE OF THE YOUNG COMRADES LEFT TOGUARD HIM  WHILE WE DISCUSSED THE SITUATION IN THE KITCHEN BIEDENBACH  WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES  HELD THAT WICKSON MUST DIE  AND WASQUITE RELIEVED WHEN WE OUTVOTED HIM AND HIS HORRIBLE PROPOSITION  ON THEOTHER HAND  WE COULD NOT DREAM OF ALLOWING THE YOUNG OLIGARCH TO DEPART  I LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO   ERNEST SAID   WE LL KEEP HIM AND GIVE HIM ANEDUCATION   I BESPEAK THE PRIVILEGE  THEN  OF ENLIGHTENING HIM IN JURISPRUDENCE  BIEDENBACH CRIED AND SO A DECISION WAS LAUGHINGLY REACHED  WE WOULD KEEP PHILIP WICKSONA PRISONER AND EDUCATE HIM IN OUR ETHICS AND SOCIOLOGY  BUT IN THEMEANTIME THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE  ALL TRACE OF THE YOUNG OLIGARCH MUSTBE OBLITERATED  THERE WERE THE MARKS HE HAD LEFT WHEN DESCENDING THECRUMBLING WALL OF THE HOLE  THIS TASK FELL TO BIEDENBACH  AND  SLUNG ONA ROPE FROM ABOVE  HE TOILED CUNNINGLY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TILL NOSIGN REMAINED  BACK UP THE CANYON FROM THE LIP OF THE HOLE ALL MARKSWERE LIKEWISE REMOVED  THEN  AT TWILIGHT  CAME JOHN CARLSON  WHODEMANDED WICKSON S SHOES THE YOUNG MAN DID NOT WANT TO GIVE UP HIS SHOES  AND EVEN OFFERED TOFIGHT FOR THEM  TILL HE FELT THE HORSESHOER S STRENGTH IN ERNEST SHANDS  CARLSON AFTERWARD REPORTED SEVERAL BLISTERS AND MUCH GRIEVOUSLOSS OF SKIN DUE TO THE SMALLNESS OF THE SHOES  BUT HE SUCCEEDED INDOING GALLANT WORK WITH THEM  BACK FROM THE LIP OF THE HOLE  WHERE ENDEDTHE YOUNG MAN S OBLITERATED TRIAL  CARLSON PUT ON THE SHOES AND WALKEDAWAY TO THE LEFT  HE WALKED FOR MILES  AROUND KNOLLS  OVER RIDGES ANDTHROUGH CANYONS  AND FINALLY COVERED THE TRAIL IN THE RUNNING WATER OFA CREEK BED  HERE HE REMOVED THE SHOES  AND  STILL HIDING TRAIL FOR ADISTANCE  AT LAST PUT ON HIS OWN SHOES  A WEEK LATER WICKSON GOT BACKHIS SHOES THAT NIGHT THE HOUNDS WERE OUT  AND THERE WAS LITTLE SLEEP IN THEREFUGE  NEXT DAY  TIME AND AGAIN  THE BAYING HOUNDS CAME DOWN THECANYON  PLUNGED OFF TO THE LEFT ON THE TRAIL CARLSON HAD MADE FOR THEM AND WERE LOST TO EAR IN THE FARTHER CANYONS HIGH UP THE MOUNTAIN  ANDALL THE TIME OUR MEN WAITED IN THE REFUGE  WEAPONS IN HAND  AUTOMATICREVOLVERS AND RIFLES  TO SAY NOTHING OF HALF A DOZEN INFERNAL MACHINESOF BIEDENBACH S MANUFACTURE  A MORE SURPRISED PARTY OF RESCUERS COULDNOT BE IMAGINED  HAD THEY VENTURED DOWN INTO OUR HIDING PLACE I HAVE NOW GIVEN THE TRUE DISAPPEARANCE OF PHILIP WICKSON  ONE TIMEOLIGARCH  AND  LATER  COMRADE IN THE REVOLUTION  FOR WE CONVERTED HIMIN THE END  HIS MIND WAS FRESH AND PLASTIC  AND BY NATURE HE WAS VERYETHICAL  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER WE RODE HIM  ON ONE OF HIS FATHER SHORSES  OVER SONOMA MOUNTAINS TO PETALUMA CREEK AND EMBARKED HIM INA SMALL FISHING LAUNCH  BY EASY STAGES WE SMUGGLED HIM ALONG OURUNDERGROUND RAILWAY TO THE CARMEL REFUGE THERE HE REMAINED EIGHT MONTHS  AT THE END OF WHICH TIME  FOR TWOREASONS  HE WAS LOATH TO LEAVE US  ONE REASON WAS THAT HE HAD FALLEN INLOVE WITH ANNA ROYLSTON  AND THE OTHER WAS THAT HE HAD BECOME ONE OFUS  IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE BECAME CONVINCED OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF HISLOVE AFFAIR THAT HE ACCEDED TO OUR WISHES AND WENT BACK TO HIS FATHER OSTENSIBLY AN OLIGARCH UNTIL HIS DEATH  HE WAS IN REALITY ONE OF THEMOST VALUABLE OF OUR AGENTS  OFTEN AND OFTEN HAS THE IRON HEEL BEENDUMBFOUNDED BY THE MISCARRIAGE OF ITS PLANS AND OPERATIONS AGAINST US IF IT BUT KNEW THE NUMBER OF ITS OWN MEMBERS WHO ARE OUR AGENTS  ITWOULD UNDERSTAND  YOUNG WICKSON NEVER WAVERED IN HIS LOYALTY TO THECAUSE  IN TRUTH  HIS VERY DEATH WAS INCURRED BY HIS DEVOTION TO DUTY IN THE GREAT STORM OF       WHILE ATTENDING A MEETING OF OUR LEADERS  HECONTRACTED THE PNEUMONIA OF WHICH HE DIED         THE CASE OF THIS YOUNG MAN WAS NOT UNUSUAL   MANY YOUNG     MEN OF THE OLIGARCHY  IMPELLED BY SENSE OF RIGHT CONDUCT  OR     THEIR IMAGINATIONS CAPTURED BY THE GLORY OF THE REVOLUTION      ETHICALLY OR ROMANTICALLY DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO IT   IN     SIMILAR WAY  MANY SONS OF THE RUSSIAN NOBILITY PLAYED THEIR     PARTS IN THE EARLIER AND PROTRACTED REVOLUTION IN THAT     COUNTRY CHAPTER XXITHE ROARING ABYSMAL BEASTDURING THE LONG PERIOD OF OUR STAY IN THE REFUGE  WE WERE KEPT CLOSELYIN TOUCH WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WITHOUT  AND WE WERELEARNING THOROUGHLY THE STRENGTH OF THE OLIGARCHY WITH WHICH WE WEREAT WAR  OUT OF THE FLUX OF TRANSITION THE NEW INSTITUTIONS WEREFORMING MORE DEFINITELY AND TAKING ON THE APPEARANCE AND ATTRIBUTESOF PERMANENCE  THE OLIGARCHS HAD SUCCEEDED IN DEVISING A GOVERNMENTALMACHINE  AS INTRICATE AS IT WAS VAST  THAT WORKED  AND THIS DESPITE ALLOUR EFFORTS TO CLOG AND HAMPER THIS WAS A SURPRISE TO MANY OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  THEY HAD NOTCONCEIVED IT POSSIBLE  NEVERTHELESS THE WORK OF THE COUNTRY WENT ON THE MEN TOILED IN THE MINES AND FIELDS  PERFORCE THEY WERE NO MORE THANSLAVES  AS FOR THE VITAL INDUSTRIES  EVERYTHING PROSPERED  THE MEMBERSOF THE GREAT LABOR CASTES WERE CONTENTED AND WORKED ON MERRILY  FOR THEFIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES THEY KNEW INDUSTRIAL PEACE  NO MORE WERE THEYWORRIED BY SLACK TIMES  STRIKE AND LOCKOUT  AND THE UNION LABEL  THEYLIVED IN MORE COMFORTABLE HOMES AND IN DELIGHTFUL CITIES OF THEIROWN  DELIGHTFUL COMPARED WITH THE SLUMS AND GHETTOS IN WHICH THEY HADFORMERLY DWELT  THEY HAD BETTER FOOD TO EAT  LESS HOURS OF LABOR  MOREHOLIDAYS  AND A GREATER AMOUNT AND VARIETY OF INTERESTS AND PLEASURES AND FOR THEIR LESS FORTUNATE BROTHERS AND SISTERS  THE UNFAVOREDLABORERS  THE DRIVEN PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  THEY CARED NOTHING  AN AGEOF SELFISHNESS WAS DAWNING UPON MANKIND  AND YET THIS IS NOT ALTOGETHERTRUE  THE LABOR CASTES WERE HONEYCOMBED BY OUR AGENTS  MEN WHOSEEYES SAW  BEYOND THE BELLY NEED  THE RADIANT FIGURE OF LIBERTY ANDBROTHERHOOD ANOTHER GREAT INSTITUTION THAT HAD TAKEN FORM AND WAS WORKING SMOOTHLYWAS THE MERCENARIES  THIS BODY OF SOLDIERS HAD BEEN EVOLVED OUT OF THEOLD REGULAR ARMY AND WAS NOW A MILLION STRONG  TO SAY NOTHING OF THECOLONIAL FORCES  THE MERCENARIES CONSTITUTED A RACE APART  THEY DWELT INCITIES OF THEIR OWN WHICH WERE PRACTICALLY SELF GOVERNED  AND THEYWERE GRANTED MANY PRIVILEGES  BY THEM A LARGE PORTION OF THE PERPLEXINGSURPLUS WAS CONSUMED  THEY WERE LOSING ALL TOUCH AND SYMPATHY WITHTHE REST OF THE PEOPLE  AND  IN FACT  WERE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN CLASSMORALITY AND CONSCIOUSNESS  AND YET WE HAD THOUSANDS OF OUR AGENTS AMONGTHEM         THE MERCENARIES  IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE IRON HEEL  PLAYED     AN IMPORTANT ROLE   THEY CONSTITUTED THE BALANCE OF POWER IN     THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE LABOR CASTES AND THE OLIGARCHS      AND NOW TO ONE SIDE AND NOW TO THE OTHER  THREW THEIR     STRENGTH ACCORDING TO THE PLAY OF INTRIGUE AND CONSPIRACY THE OLIGARCHS THEMSELVES WERE GOING THROUGH A REMARKABLE AND  IT MUSTBE CONFESSED  UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT  AS A CLASS  THEY DISCIPLINEDTHEMSELVES  EVERY MEMBER HAD HIS WORK TO DO IN THE WORLD  AND THIS WORKHE WAS COMPELLED TO DO  THERE WERE NO MORE IDLE RICH YOUNG MEN  THEIRSTRENGTH WAS USED TO GIVE UNITED STRENGTH TO THE OLIGARCHY  THEY SERVEDAS LEADERS OF TROOPS AND AS LIEUTENANTS AND CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY THEY FOUND CAREERS IN APPLIED SCIENCE  AND MANY OF THEM BECAME GREATENGINEERS  THEY WENT INTO THE MULTITUDINOUS DIVISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT TOOK SERVICE IN THE COLONIAL POSSESSIONS  AND BY TENS OF THOUSANDS WENTINTO THE VARIOUS SECRET SERVICES  THEY WERE  I MAY SAY  APPRENTICEDTO EDUCATION  TO ART  TO THE CHURCH  TO SCIENCE  TO LITERATURE  ANDIN THOSE FIELDS THEY SERVED THE IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF MOULDING THETHOUGHT PROCESSES OF THE NATION IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PERPETUITY OFTHE OLIGARCHY THEY WERE TAUGHT  AND LATER THEY IN TURN TAUGHT  THAT WHAT THEY WEREDOING WAS RIGHT  THEY ASSIMILATED THE ARISTOCRATIC IDEA FROM THE MOMENTTHEY BEGAN  AS CHILDREN  TO RECEIVE IMPRESSIONS OF THE WORLD  THEARISTOCRATIC IDEA WAS WOVEN INTO THE MAKING OF THEM UNTIL IT BECAME BONEOF THEM AND FLESH OF THEM  THEY LOOKED UPON THEMSELVES AS WILD ANIMALTRAINERS  RULERS OF BEASTS  FROM BENEATH THEIR FEET ROSE ALWAYS THESUBTERRANEAN RUMBLES OF REVOLT  VIOLENT DEATH EVER STALKED IN THEIRMIDST  BOMB AND KNIFE AND BULLET WERE LOOKED UPON AS SO MANY FANGSOF THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST THEY MUST DOMINATE IF HUMANITY WERETO PERSIST  THEY WERE THE SAVIOURS OF HUMANITY  AND THEY REGARDEDTHEMSELVES AS HEROIC AND SACRIFICING LABORERS FOR THE HIGHEST GOOD THEY  AS A CLASS  BELIEVED THAT THEY ALONE MAINTAINED CIVILIZATION IT WAS THEIR BELIEF THAT IF EVER THEY WEAKENED  THE GREAT BEAST WOULDINGULF THEM AND EVERYTHING OF BEAUTY AND WONDER AND JOY AND GOOD IN ITSCAVERNOUS AND SLIME DRIPPING MAW  WITHOUT THEM  ANARCHY WOULD REIGN ANDHUMANITY WOULD DROP BACKWARD INTO THE PRIMITIVE NIGHT OUT OF WHICH ITHAD SO PAINFULLY EMERGED  THE HORRID PICTURE OF ANARCHY WAS HELDALWAYS BEFORE THEIR CHILD S EYES UNTIL THEY  IN TURN  OBSESSED BY THISCULTIVATED FEAR  HELD THE PICTURE OF ANARCHY BEFORE THE EYES OF THECHILDREN THAT FOLLOWED THEM  THIS WAS THE BEAST TO BE STAMPED UPON  ANDTHE HIGHEST DUTY OF THE ARISTOCRAT WAS TO STAMP UPON IT  IN SHORT THEY ALONE  BY THEIR UNREMITTING TOIL AND SACRIFICE  STOOD BETWEENWEAK HUMANITY AND THE ALL DEVOURING BEAST  AND THEY BELIEVED IT  FIRMLYBELIEVED IT I CANNOT LAY TOO GREAT STRESS UPON THIS HIGH ETHICAL RIGHTEOUSNESS OFTHE WHOLE OLIGARCH CLASS  THIS HAS BEEN THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL AND TOO MANY OF THE COMRADES HAVE BEEN SLOW OR LOATH TO REALIZE IT  MANYOF THEM HAVE ASCRIBED THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL TO ITS SYSTEM OFREWARD AND PUNISHMENT  THIS IS A MISTAKE  HEAVEN AND HELL MAY BE THEPRIME FACTORS OF ZEAL IN THE RELIGION OF A FANATIC  BUT FOR THE GREATMAJORITY OF THE RELIGIOUS  HEAVEN AND HELL ARE INCIDENTAL TO RIGHTAND WRONG  LOVE OF THE RIGHT  DESIRE FOR THE RIGHT  UNHAPPINESS WITHANYTHING LESS THAN THE RIGHT  IN SHORT  RIGHT CONDUCT  IS THE PRIMEFACTOR OF RELIGION  AND SO WITH THE OLIGARCHY  PRISONS  BANISHMENT ANDDEGRADATION  HONORS AND PALACES AND WONDER CITIES  ARE ALL INCIDENTAL THE GREAT DRIVING FORCE OF THE OLIGARCHS IS THE BELIEF THAT THEY AREDOING RIGHT  NEVER MIND THE EXCEPTIONS  AND NEVER MIND THE OPPRESSIONAND INJUSTICE IN WHICH THE IRON HEEL WAS CONCEIVED  ALL IS GRANTED  THEPOINT IS THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE OLIGARCHY TODAY LIES IN ITS SATISFIEDCONCEPTION OF ITS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS         OUT OF THE ETHICAL INCOHERENCY AND INCONSISTENCY OF     CAPITALISM  THE OLIGARCHS EMERGED WITH A NEW ETHICS      COHERENT AND DEFINITE  SHARP AND SEVERE AS STEEL  THE MOST     ABSURD AND UNSCIENTIFIC AND AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST POTENT     EVER POSSESSED BY ANY TYRANT CLASS  THE OLIGARCHS BELIEVED     THEIR ETHICS  IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT BIOLOGY AND     EVOLUTION GAVE THEM THE LIE  AND  BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH      FOR THREE CENTURIES THEY WERE ABLE TO HOLD BACK THE MIGHTY     TIDE OF HUMAN PROGRESS  A SPECTACLE  PROFOUND  TREMENDOUS      PUZZLING TO THE METAPHYSICAL MORALIST  AND ONE THAT TO THE     MATERIALIST IS THE CAUSE OF MANY DOUBTS AND     RECONSIDERATIONS FOR THAT MATTER  THE STRENGTH OF THE REVOLUTION  DURING THESEFRIGHTFUL TWENTY YEARS  HAS RESIDED IN NOTHING ELSE THAN THE SENSEOF RIGHTEOUSNESS  IN NO OTHER WAY CAN BE EXPLAINED OUR SACRIFICES ANDMARTYRDOMS  FOR NO OTHER REASON DID RUDOLPH MENDENHALL FLAME OUT HISSOUL FOR THE CAUSE AND SING HIS WILD SWAN SONG THAT LAST NIGHT OF LIFE FOR NO OTHER REASON DID HURLBERT DIE UNDER TORTURE  REFUSING TO THE LASTTO BETRAY HIS COMRADES  FOR NO OTHER REASON HAS ANNA ROYLSTON REFUSEDBLESSED MOTHERHOOD  FOR NO OTHER REASON HAS JOHN CARLSON BEEN THEFAITHFUL AND UNREWARDED CUSTODIAN OF THE GLEN ELLEN REFUGE  IT DOESNOT MATTER  YOUNG OR OLD  MAN OR WOMAN  HIGH OR LOW  GENIUS OR CLOD GO WHERE ONE WILL AMONG THE COMRADES OF THE REVOLUTION  THE MOTOR FORCEWILL BE FOUND TO BE A GREAT AND ABIDING DESIRE FOR THE RIGHT BUT I HAVE RUN AWAY FROM MY NARRATIVE  ERNEST AND I WELL UNDERSTOOD BEFORE WE LEFT THE REFUGE  HOW THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL WASDEVELOPING  THE LABOR CASTES  THE MERCENARIES  AND THE GREAT HORDESOF SECRET AGENTS AND POLICE OF VARIOUS SORTS WERE ALL PLEDGED TO THEOLIGARCHY  IN THE MAIN  AND IGNORING THE LOSS OF LIBERTY  THEY WEREBETTER OFF THAN THEY HAD BEEN  ON THE OTHER HAND  THE GREAT HELPLESSMASS OF THE POPULATION  THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  WAS SINKING INTO ABRUTISH APATHY OF CONTENT WITH MISERY  WHENEVER STRONG PROLETARIANSASSERTED THEIR STRENGTH IN THE MIDST OF THE MASS  THEY WERE DRAWN AWAYFROM THE MASS BY THE OLIGARCHS AND GIVEN BETTER CONDITIONS BY BEING MADEMEMBERS OF THE LABOR CASTES OR OF THE MERCENARIES  THUS DISCONTENT WASLULLED AND THE PROLETARIAT ROBBED OF ITS NATURAL LEADERS THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS WAS PITIABLE  COMMON SCHOOLEDUCATION  SO FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED  HAD CEASED  THEY LIVEDLIKE BEASTS IN GREAT SQUALID LABOR GHETTOS  FESTERING IN MISERY ANDDEGRADATION  ALL THEIR OLD LIBERTIES WERE GONE  THEY WERE LABOR SLAVES CHOICE OF WORK WAS DENIED THEM  LIKEWISE WAS DENIED THEM THE RIGHT TOMOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE  OR THE RIGHT TO BEAR OR POSSESS ARMS  THEYWERE NOT LAND SERFS LIKE THE FARMERS  THEY WERE MACHINE SERFS ANDLABOR SERFS  WHEN UNUSUAL NEEDS AROSE FOR THEM  SUCH AS THE BUILDINGOF THE GREAT HIGHWAYS AND AIR LINES  OF CANALS  TUNNELS  SUBWAYS  ANDFORTIFICATIONS  LEVIES WERE MADE ON THE LABOR GHETTOS  AND TENS OFTHOUSANDS OF SERFS  WILLY NILLY  WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE SCENE OFOPERATIONS  GREAT ARMIES OF THEM ARE TOILING NOW AT THE BUILDING OFARDIS  HOUSED IN WRETCHED BARRACKS WHERE FAMILY LIFE CANNOT EXIST  ANDWHERE DECENCY IS DISPLACED BY DULL BESTIALITY  IN ALL TRUTH  THERE INTHE LABOR GHETTOS IS THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST THE OLIGARCHS FEAR SODREADFULLY  BUT IT IS THE BEAST OF THEIR OWN MAKING  IN IT THEY WILL NOTLET THE APE AND TIGER DIE AND JUST NOW THE WORD HAS GONE FORTH THAT NEW LEVIES ARE BEING IMPOSEDFOR THE BUILDING OF ASGARD  THE PROJECTED WONDER CITY THAT WILL FAREXCEED ARDIS WHEN THE LATTER IS COMPLETED   WE OF THE REVOLUTION WILL GOON WITH THAT GREAT WORK  BUT IT WILL NOT BE DONE BY THE MISERABLE SERFS THE WALLS AND TOWERS AND SHAFTS OF THAT FAIR CITY WILL ARISE TO THESOUND OF SINGING  AND INTO ITS BEAUTY AND WONDER WILL BE WOVEN  NOTSIGHS AND GROANS  BUT MUSIC AND LAUGHTER        ARDIS WAS COMPLETED IN      A D   ASGARD WAS NOT COMPLETED     UNTIL      A D   IT WAS FIFTY TWO YEARS IN THE BUILDING      DURING WHICH TIME A PERMANENT ARMY OF HALF A MILLION SERFS     WAS EMPLOYED   AT TIMES THESE NUMBERS SWELLED TO OVER A     MILLION  WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNT BEING TAKEN OF THE HUNDREDS OF     THOUSANDS OF THE LABOR CASTES AND THE ARTISTS ERNEST WAS MADLY IMPATIENT TO BE OUT IN THE WORLD AND DOING  FOR OURILL FATED FIRST REVOLT  THAT HAD MISCARRIED IN THE CHICAGO COMMUNE  WASRIPENING FAST  YET HE POSSESSED HIS SOUL WITH PATIENCE  AND DURING THISTIME OF HIS TORMENT  WHEN HADLY  WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT FOR THE PURPOSEFROM ILLINOIS  MADE HIM OVER INTO ANOTHER MAN  HE REVOLVED GREAT PLANSIN HIS HEAD FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE LEARNED PROLETARIAT  AND FOR THEMAINTENANCE OF AT LEAST THE RUDIMENTS OF EDUCATION AMONGST THE PEOPLE OFTHE ABYSS  ALL THIS OF COURSE IN THE EVENT OF THE FIRST REVOLT BEING AFAILURE        AMONG THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE MANY SURGEONS  AND IN     VIVISECTION THEY ATTAINED MARVELLOUS PROFICIENCY   IN AVIS     EVERHARD S WORDS  THEY COULD LITERALLY MAKE A MAN OVER   TO     THEM THE ELIMINATION OF SCARS AND DISFIGUREMENTS WAS A     TRIVIAL DETAIL   THEY CHANGED THE FEATURES WITH SUCH     MICROSCOPIC CARE THAT NO TRACES WERE LEFT OF THEIR     HANDIWORK   THE NOSE WAS A FAVORITE ORGAN TO WORK UPON      SKIN GRAFTING AND HAIR TRANSPLANTING WERE AMONG THEIR     COMMONEST DEVICES   THE CHANGES IN EXPRESSION THEY     ACCOMPLISHED WERE WIZARD LIKE   EYES AND EYEBROWS  LIPS      MOUTHS  AND EARS  WERE RADICALLY ALTERED   BY CUNNING     OPERATIONS ON TONGUE  THROAT  LARYNX  AND NASAL CAVITIES A     MAN S WHOLE ENUNCIATION AND MANNER OF SPEECH COULD BE     CHANGED   DESPERATE TIMES GIVE NEED FOR DESPERATE REMEDIES      AND THE SURGEONS OF THE REVOLUTION ROSE TO THE NEED   AMONG     OTHER THINGS  THEY COULD INCREASE AN ADULT S STATURE BY AS     MUCH AS FOUR OR FIVE INCHES AND DECREASE IT BY ONE OR TWO     INCHES   WHAT THEY DID IS TO DAY A LOST ART   WE HAVE NO     NEED FOR IT IT WAS NOT UNTIL JANUARY        THAT WE LEFT THE REFUGE  ALL HAD BEENARRANGED  WE TOOK OUR PLACE AT ONCE AS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS IN THE SCHEMEOF THE IRON HEEL  I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ERNEST S SISTER  BY OLIGARCHS ANDCOMRADES ON THE INSIDE WHO WERE HIGH IN AUTHORITY  PLACE HAD BEEN MADEFOR US  WE WERE IN POSSESSION OF ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTS  AND OUR PASTSWERE ACCOUNTED FOR  WITH HELP ON THE INSIDE  THIS WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR IN THAT SHADOW WORLD OF SECRET SERVICE IDENTITY WAS NEBULOUS  LIKEGHOSTS THE AGENTS CAME AND WENT  OBEYING COMMANDS  FULFILLING DUTIES FOLLOWING CLEWS  MAKING THEIR REPORTS OFTEN TO OFFICERS THEY NEVER SAWOR COOPERATING WITH OTHER AGENTS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND WOULDNEVER SEE AGAIN CHAPTER XXIITHE CHICAGO COMMUNEAS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS  NOT ALONE WERE WE ABLE TO TRAVEL A GREAT DEAL BUT OUR VERY WORK THREW US IN CONTACT WITH THE PROLETARIAT AND WITH OURCOMRADES  THE REVOLUTIONISTS  THUS WE WERE IN BOTH CAMPS AT THE SAMETIME  OSTENSIBLY SERVING THE IRON HEEL AND SECRETLY WORKING WITH ALLOUR MIGHT FOR THE CAUSE  THERE WERE MANY OF US IN THE VARIOUSSECRET SERVICES OF THE OLIGARCHY  AND DESPITE THE SHAKINGS UP ANDREORGANIZATIONS THE SECRET SERVICES HAVE UNDERGONE  THEY HAVE NEVER BEENABLE TO WEED ALL OF US OUT ERNEST HAD LARGELY PLANNED THE FIRST REVOLT  AND THE DATE SET HAD BEENSOMEWHERE EARLY IN THE SPRING OF       IN THE FALL OF      WE WERE NOTREADY  MUCH REMAINED TO BE DONE  AND WHEN THE REVOLT WAS PRECIPITATED OF COURSE IT WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE  THE PLOT OF NECESSITY WASFRIGHTFULLY INTRICATE  AND ANYTHING PREMATURE WAS SURE TO DESTROY IT THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY WE HAD PLANNED TO STRIKE OUR FIRST BLOW AT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THEOLIGARCHY  THE LATTER HAD REMEMBERED THE GENERAL STRIKE  AND HADGUARDED AGAINST THE DEFECTION OF THE TELEGRAPHERS BY INSTALLING WIRELESSSTATIONS  IN THE CONTROL OF THE MERCENARIES  WE  IN TURN  HAD COUNTEREDTHIS MOVE  WHEN THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN  FROM EVERY REFUGE  ALL OVER THELAND  AND FROM THE CITIES  AND TOWNS  AND BARRACKS  DEVOTED COMRADESWERE TO GO FORTH AND BLOW UP THE WIRELESS STATIONS  THUS AT THE FIRSTSHOCK WOULD THE IRON HEEL BE BROUGHT TO EARTH AND LIE PRACTICALLYDISMEMBERED AT THE SAME MOMENT  OTHER COMRADES WERE TO BLOW UP THE BRIDGES ANDTUNNELS AND DISRUPT THE WHOLE NETWORK OF RAILROADS  STILL FURTHER  OTHERGROUPS OF COMRADES  AT THE SIGNAL  WERE TO SEIZE THE OFFICERS OF THEMERCENARIES AND THE POLICE  AS WELL AS ALL OLIGARCHS OF UNUSUAL ABILITYOR WHO HELD EXECUTIVE POSITIONS  THUS WOULD THE LEADERS OF THE ENEMYBE REMOVED FROM THE FIELD OF THE LOCAL BATTLES THAT WOULD INEVITABLY BEFOUGHT ALL OVER THE LAND MANY THINGS WERE TO OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY WHEN THE SIGNAL WENT FORTH  THECANADIAN AND MEXICAN PATRIOTS  WHO WERE FAR STRONGER THAN THE IRON HEELDREAMED  WERE TO DUPLICATE OUR TACTICS  THEN THERE WERE COMRADES  THESEWERE THE WOMEN  FOR THE MEN WOULD BE BUSY ELSEWHERE  WHO WERE TO POSTTHE PROCLAMATIONS FROM OUR SECRET PRESSES  THOSE OF US IN THE HIGHEREMPLOY OF THE IRON HEEL WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO MAKE CONFUSIONAND ANARCHY IN ALL OUR DEPARTMENTS  INSIDE THE MERCENARIES WERETHOUSANDS OF OUR COMRADES  THEIR WORK WAS TO BLOW UP THE MAGAZINESAND TO DESTROY THE DELICATE MECHANISM OF ALL THE WAR MACHINERY  IN THECITIES OF THE MERCENARIES AND OF THE LABOR CASTES SIMILAR PROGRAMMES OFDISRUPTION WERE TO BE CARRIED OUT IN SHORT  A SUDDEN  COLOSSAL  STUNNING BLOW WAS TO BE STRUCK  BEFORE THEPARALYZED OLIGARCHY COULD RECOVER ITSELF  ITS END WOULD HAVE COME IT WOULD HAVE MEANT TERRIBLE TIMES AND GREAT LOSS OF LIFE  BUT NOREVOLUTIONIST HESITATES AT SUCH THINGS  WHY  WE EVEN DEPENDED MUCH  INOUR PLAN  ON THE UNORGANIZED PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  THEY WERE TO BE LOOSEDON THE PALACES AND CITIES OF THE MASTERS  NEVER MIND THE DESTRUCTIONOF LIFE AND PROPERTY  LET THE ABYSMAL BRUTE ROAR AND THE POLICE ANDMERCENARIES SLAY  THE ABYSMAL BRUTE WOULD ROAR ANYWAY  AND THE POLICEAND MERCENARIES WOULD SLAY ANYWAY  IT WOULD MERELY MEAN THAT VARIOUSDANGERS TO US WERE HARMLESSLY DESTROYING ONE ANOTHER  IN THE MEANTIME WEWOULD BE DOING OUR OWN WORK  LARGELY UNHAMPERED  AND GAINING CONTROL OFALL THE MACHINERY OF SOCIETY SUCH WAS OUR PLAN  EVERY DETAIL OF WHICH HAD TO BE WORKED OUT IN SECRET AND  AS THE DAY DREW NEAR  COMMUNICATED TO MORE AND MORE COMRADES THIS WAS THE DANGER POINT  THE STRETCHING OF THE CONSPIRACY  BUT THATDANGER POINT WAS NEVER REACHED  THROUGH ITS SPY SYSTEM THE IRON HEELGOT WIND OF THE REVOLT AND PREPARED TO TEACH US ANOTHER OF ITS BLOODYLESSONS  CHICAGO WAS THE DEVOTED CITY SELECTED FOR THE INSTRUCTION  ANDWELL WERE WE INSTRUCTED CHICAGO  WAS THE RIPEST OF ALL  CHICAGO WHICH OF OLD TIME WAS THE CITYOF BLOOD AND WHICH WAS TO EARN ANEW ITS NAME  THERE THE REVOLUTIONARYSPIRIT WAS STRONG  TOO MANY BITTER STRIKES HAD BEEN CURBED THERE IN THEDAYS OF CAPITALISM FOR THE WORKERS TO FORGET AND FORGIVE  EVEN THELABOR CASTES OF THE CITY WERE ALIVE WITH REVOLT  TOO MANY HEADS HADBEEN BROKEN IN THE EARLY STRIKES  DESPITE THEIR CHANGED AND FAVORABLECONDITIONS  THEIR HATRED FOR THE MASTER CLASS HAD NOT DIED  THIS SPIRITHAD INFECTED THE MERCENARIES  OF WHICH THREE REGIMENTS IN PARTICULARWERE READY TO COME OVER TO US EN MASSE        CHICAGO WAS THE INDUSTRIAL INFERNO OF THE NINETEENTH     CENTURY A D  A CURIOUS ANECDOTE HAS COME DOWN TO US OF JOHN     BURNS  A GREAT ENGLISH LABOR LEADER AND ONE TIME MEMBER OF     THE BRITISH CABINET  IN CHICAGO  WHILE ON A VISIT TO THE     UNITED STATES  HE WAS ASKED BY A NEWSPAPER REPORTER FOR HIS     OPINION OF THAT CITY    CHICAGO   HE ANSWERED   IS A POCKET     EDITION OF HELL    SOME TIME LATER  AS HE WAS GOING ABOARD     HIS STEAMER TO SAIL TO ENGLAND  HE WAS APPROACHED BY ANOTHER     REPORTER  WHO WANTED TO KNOW IF HE HAD CHANGED HIS OPINION     OF CHICAGO    YES  I HAVE   WAS HIS REPLY    MY PRESENT     OPINION IS THAT HELL IS A POCKET EDITION OF CHICAGO  CHICAGO HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE STORM CENTRE OF THE CONFLICT BETWEENLABOR AND CAPITAL  A CITY OF STREET BATTLES AND VIOLENT DEATH  WITH ACLASS CONSCIOUS CAPITALIST ORGANIZATION AND A CLASS CONSCIOUS WORKMANORGANIZATION  WHERE  IN THE OLD DAYS  THE VERY SCHOOL TEACHERS WEREFORMED INTO LABOR UNIONS AND AFFILIATED WITH THE HOD CARRIERS ANDBRICK LAYERS IN THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR  AND CHICAGO BECAME THESTORM CENTRE OF THE PREMATURE FIRST REVOLT THE TROUBLE WAS PRECIPITATED BY THE IRON HEEL  IT WAS CLEVERLY DONE  THEWHOLE POPULATION  INCLUDING THE FAVORED LABOR CASTES  WAS GIVEN A COURSEOF OUTRAGEOUS TREATMENT  PROMISES AND AGREEMENTS WERE BROKEN  AND MOSTDRASTIC PUNISHMENTS VISITED UPON EVEN PETTY OFFENDERS  THE PEOPLE OFTHE ABYSS WERE TORMENTED OUT OF THEIR APATHY  IN FACT  THE IRON HEEL WASPREPARING TO MAKE THE ABYSMAL BEAST ROAR  AND HAND IN HAND WITH THIS  INALL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES IN CHICAGO  THE IRON HEEL WAS INCONCEIVABLYCARELESS  DISCIPLINE WAS RELAXED AMONG THE MERCENARIES THAT REMAINED WHILE MANY REGIMENTS HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN AND SENT TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THECOUNTRY IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO CARRY OUT THIS PROGRAMME  ONLY SEVERAL WEEKS  WEOF THE REVOLUTION CAUGHT VAGUE RUMORS OF THE STATE OF AFFAIRS  BUT HADNOTHING DEFINITE ENOUGH FOR AN UNDERSTANDING  IN FACT  WE THOUGHT IT WASA SPONTANEOUS SPIRIT OF REVOLT THAT WOULD REQUIRE CAREFUL CURBING ON OURPART  AND NEVER DREAMED THAT IT WAS DELIBERATELY MANUFACTURED  AND ITHAD BEEN MANUFACTURED SO SECRETLY  FROM THE VERY INNERMOST CIRCLE OFTHE IRON HEEL  THAT WE HAD GOT NO INKLING  THE COUNTER PLOT WAS AN ABLEACHIEVEMENT  AND ABLY CARRIED OUT I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN I RECEIVED THE ORDER TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TOCHICAGO  THE MAN WHO GAVE ME THE ORDER WAS ONE OF THE OLIGARCHS  I COULDTELL THAT BY HIS SPEECH  THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME NOR SEE HISFACE  HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE TOO CLEAR FOR ME TO MAKE A MISTAKE  PLAINLYI READ BETWEEN THE LINES THAT OUR PLOT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED  THAT WE HADBEEN COUNTERMINED  THE EXPLOSION WAS READY FOR THE FLASH OF POWDER  ANDCOUNTLESS AGENTS OF THE IRON HEEL  INCLUDING ME  EITHER ON THE GROUNDOR BEING SENT THERE  WERE TO SUPPLY THAT FLASH  I FLATTER MYSELF THAT IMAINTAINED MY COMPOSURE UNDER THE KEEN EYE OF THE OLIGARCH  BUT MY HEARTWAS BEATING MADLY  I COULD ALMOST HAVE SHRIEKED AND FLOWN AT HIS THROATWITH

CURIOUSLY AT US AS WE THUNDERED PAST WITHOUTSLACKENING OUR TERRIFIC SPEED ALL WAS QUIET AS WE ENTERED CHICAGO  IT WAS EVIDENT NOTHING HAD HAPPENEDYET  IN THE SUBURBS THE MORNING PAPERS CAME ON BOARD THE TRAIN  THEREWAS NOTHING IN THEM  AND YET THERE WAS MUCH IN THEM FOR THOSE SKILLEDIN READING BETWEEN THE LINES THAT IT WAS INTENDED THE ORDINARY READERSHOULD READ INTO THE TEXT  THE FINE HAND OF THE IRON HEEL WAS APPARENTIN EVERY COLUMN  GLIMMERINGS OF WEAKNESS IN THE ARMOR OF THE OLIGARCHYWERE GIVEN  OF COURSE  THERE WAS NOTHING DEFINITE  IT WAS INTENDED THATTHE READER SHOULD FEEL HIS WAY TO THESE GLIMMERINGS  IT WASCLEVERLY DONE  AS FICTION  THOSE MORNING PAPERS OF OCTOBER   TH WEREMASTERPIECES THE LOCAL NEWS WAS MISSING  THIS IN ITSELF WAS A MASTERSTROKE  ITSHROUDED CHICAGO IN MYSTERY  AND IT SUGGESTED TO THE AVERAGE CHICAGOREADER THAT THE OLIGARCHY DID NOT DARE GIVE THE LOCAL NEWS  HINTS THATWERE UNTRUE  OF COURSE  WERE GIVEN OF INSUBORDINATION ALL OVER THE LAND CRUDELY DISGUISED WITH COMPLACENT REFERENCES TO PUNITIVE MEASURES TO BETAKEN  THERE WERE REPORTS OF NUMEROUS WIRELESS STATIONS THAT HADBEEN BLOWN UP  WITH HEAVY REWARDS OFFERED FOR THE DETECTION OF THEPERPETRATORS  OF COURSE NO WIRELESS STATIONS HAD BEEN BLOWN UP  MANYSIMILAR OUTRAGES  THAT DOVETAILED WITH THE PLOT OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE GIVEN  THE IMPRESSION TO BE MADE ON THE MINDS OF THE CHICAGOCOMRADES WAS THAT THE GENERAL REVOLT WAS BEGINNING  ALBEIT WITH ACONFUSING MISCARRIAGE IN MANY DETAILS  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONEUNINFORMED TO ESCAPE THE VAGUE YET CERTAIN FEELING THAT ALL THE LAND WASRIPE FOR THE REVOLT THAT HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO BREAK OUT IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE DEFECTION OF THE MERCENARIES IN CALIFORNIA HADBECOME SO SERIOUS THAT HALF A DOZEN REGIMENTS HAD BEEN DISBANDED ANDBROKEN  AND THAT THEIR MEMBERS WITH THEIR FAMILIES HAD BEEN DRIVENFROM THEIR OWN CITY AND ON INTO THE LABOR GHETTOS  AND THE CALIFORNIAMERCENARIES WERE IN REALITY THE MOST FAITHFUL OF ALL TO THEIR SALT BUT HOW WAS

WITHTHE STATEMENT  INTENDED TO BE ACCEPTED AS A BLUFF   THAT THE TROOPS HADTHE SITUATION IN HAND        A LIE AND AS THE OLIGARCHS HAD DONE WITH THE MORNING PAPERS  SO HAD THEY DONEIN A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS  THESE WE LEARNED AFTERWARD  AS  FOR EXAMPLE THE SECRET MESSAGES OF THE OLIGARCHS  SENT WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OFLEAKING TO THE EARS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  THAT HAD COME OVER THE WIRES NOW AND AGAIN  DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE NIGHT  I GUESS THE IRON HEEL WON T NEED OUR SERVICES   HARTMAN REMARKED PUTTING DOWN THE PAPER HE HAD BEEN READING  WHEN THE TRAIN PULLED INTOTHE CENTRAL DEPOT

WENT THEIR WAYS WITH GREAT HASTE AND DEFINITENESS WITHAL THERE WAS A CURIOUS INDECISION IN THEIR MOVEMENTS  AS THOUGH THEYEXPECTED THE BUILDINGS TO TOPPLE OVER ON THEM OR THE SIDEWALKS TO SINKUNDER THEIR FEET OR FLY UP IN THE AIR  A FEW GAMINS  HOWEVER  WEREAROUND  IN THEIR EYES A SUPPRESSED EAGERNESS IN ANTICIPATION OFWONDERFUL AND EXCITING THINGS TO HAPPEN FROM SOMEWHERE  FAR TO THE SOUTH  THE DULL SOUND OF AN EXPLOSION CAME TOOUR EARS  THAT WAS ALL  THEN QUIET AGAIN  THOUGH THE GAMINS HAD STARTLEDAND LISTENED  LIKE YOUNG DEER  AT THE SOUND  THE DOORWAYS TO ALL THEBUILDINGS WERE CLOSED  THE SHUTTERS TO THE SHOPS WERE UP  BUT THEREWERE MANY POLICE AND WATCHMEN IN EVIDENCE  AND NOW AND AGAIN AUTOMOBILEPATROLS OF THE MERCENARIES SLIPPED SWIFTLY PAST HARTMAN AND I AGREED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO REPORT OURSELVES TO THELOCAL CHIEFS OF THE SECRET SERVICE  OUR FAILURE SO TO REPORT WOULD BEEXCUSED  WE KNEW  IN THE LIGHT OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  SO WE HEADED FORTHE GREAT LABOR GHETTO ON THE SOUTH SIDE IN THE HOPE OF GETTING INCONTACT WITH SOME OF THE COMRADES  TOO LATE  WE KNEW IT  BUT WE COULDNOT STAND STILL AND DO NOTHING IN THOSE GHASTLY  SILENT STREETS  WHEREWAS ERNEST  I WAS WONDERING  WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CITIES OF THELABOR CASTES AND MERCENARIES  IN THE FORTRESSES AS IF IN ANSWER  A GREAT SCREAMING ROAR WENT UP  DIM WITH DISTANCE PUNCTUATED WITH DETONATION AFTER DETONATION  IT S THE FORTRESSES   HARTMAN SAID   GOD PITY THOSE THREE REGIMENTS  AT A CROSSING WE NOTICED  IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STOCKYARDS  A GIGANTICPILLAR OF SMOKE  AT THE NEXT CROSSING SEVERAL SIMILAR SMOKE PILLARS WERERISING SKYWARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WEST SIDE  OVER THE CITY OF THEMERCENARIES WE SAW A GREAT CAPTIVE WAR BALLOON THAT BURST EVEN AS WELOOKED AT IT  AND FELL IN FLAMING WRECKAGE TOWARD THE EARTH  THERE WASNO CLEW TO THAT TRAGEDY OF THE AIR  WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER THEBALLOON HAD BEEN MANNED BY COMRADES OR ENEMIES  A VAGUE SOUND CAME TOOUR EARS  LIKE THE BUBBLING OF A GIGANTIC CALDRON A LONG WAY OFF  ANDHARTMAN SAID IT WAS MACHINE GUNS AND AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND STILL WE WALKED IN IMMEDIATE QUIETUDE  NOTHING WAS HAPPENING WHEREWE WERE  THE POLICE AND THE AUTOMOBILE PATROLS WENT BY  AND ONCE HALFA DOZEN FIRE ENGINES  RETURNING EVIDENTLY FROM SOME CONFLAGRATION  AQUESTION WAS CALLED TO THE FIREMAN BY AN OFFICER IN AN AUTOMOBILE  ANDWE HEARD ONE SHOUT IN REPLY   NO WATER  THEY VE BLOWN UP THE MAINS   WE VE SMASHED THE WATER SUPPLY   HARTMAN CRIED EXCITEDLY TO ME   IF WECAN DO ALL THIS IN A PREMATURE  ISOLATED  ABORTIVE ATTEMPT  WHAT CAN TWE DO IN A CONCERTED  RIPENED EFFORT ALL OVER THE LAND  THE AUTOMOBILE CONTAINING THE OFFICER WHO HAD ASKED THE QUESTION DARTEDON  SUDDENLY THERE WAS A DEAFENING ROAR  THE MACHINE  WITH ITS HUMANFREIGHT  LIFTED IN AN UPBURST OF SMOKE  AND SANK DOWN A MASS OF WRECKAGEAND DEATH HARTMAN WAS JUBILANT   WELL DONE  WELL DONE   HE WAS REPEATING  OVERAND OVER  IN A WHISPER   THE PROLETARIAT GETS ITS LESSON TO DAY  BUT ITGIVES ONE  TOO  POLICE WERE RUNNING FOR THE SPOT  ALSO  ANOTHER PATROL MACHINE HADHALTED  AS FOR MYSELF  I WAS IN A DAZE  THE SUDDENNESS OF IT WASSTUNNING  HOW HAD IT HAPPENED  I KNEW NOT HOW  AND YET I HAD BEENLOOKING DIRECTLY AT IT  SO DAZED WAS I FOR THE MOMENT THAT I WASSCARCELY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE WERE BEING HELD UP BY THE POLICE  IABRUPTLY SAW THAT A POLICEMAN WAS IN THE ACT OF SHOOTING HARTMAN  BUTHARTMAN WAS COOL AND WAS GIVING THE PROPER PASSWORDS  I SAW THE LEVELLEDREVOLVER HESITATE  THEN SINK DOWN  AND HEARD THE DISGUSTED GRUNT OF THEPOLICEMAN  HE WAS VERY ANGRY  AND WAS CURSING THE WHOLE SECRET SERVICE IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE WAY  HE WAS AVERRING  WHILE HARTMAN WAS TALKINGBACK TO HIM AND WITH FITTING SECRET SERVICE PRIDE EXPLAINING TO HIM THECLUMSINESS OF THE POLICE THE NEXT MOMENT I KNEW HOW IT HAD HAPPENED  THERE WAS QUITE A GROUPABOUT THE WRECK  AND TWO MEN WERE JUST LIFTING UP THE WOUNDED OFFICERTO CARRY HIM TO THE OTHER MACHINE  A PANIC SEIZED ALL OF THEM  ANDTHEY SCATTERED IN EVERY DIRECTION  RUNNING IN BLIND TERROR  THE WOUNDEDOFFICER  ROUGHLY DROPPED  BEING LEFT BEHIND  THE CURSING POLICEMANALONGSIDE OF ME ALSO RAN  AND HARTMAN AND I RAN  TOO  WE KNEW NOT WHY OBSESSED WITH THE SAME BLIND TERROR TO GET AWAY FROM THAT PARTICULARSPOT NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED THEN  BUT EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED  THE FLYINGMEN WERE SHEEPISHLY COMING BACK  BUT ALL THE WHILE THEIR EYES WERERAISED APPREHENSIVELY TO THE MANY WINDOWED  LOFTY BUILDINGS THAT TOWEREDLIKE THE SHEER WALLS OF A CANYON ON EACH SIDE OF THE STREET  FROM ONEOF THOSE COUNTLESS WINDOWS THE BOMB HAD BEEN THROWN  BUT WHICH WINDOW THERE HAD BEEN NO SECOND BOMB  ONLY A FEAR OF ONE THEREAFTER WE LOOKED WITH SPECULATIVE COMPREHENSION AT THE WINDOWS ANY OF THEM CONTAINED POSSIBLE DEATH  EACH BUILDING WAS A POSSIBLEAMBUSCADE  THIS WAS WARFARE IN THAT MODERN JUNGLE  A GREAT CITY  EVERYSTREET WAS A CANYON  EVERY BUILDING A MOUNTAIN  WE HAD NOT CHANGED MUCHFROM PRIMITIVE MAN  DESPITE THE WAR AUTOMOBILES THAT WERE SLIDING BY TURNING A CORNER  WE CAME UPON A WOMAN  SHE WAS LYING ON THE PAVEMENT IN A POOL OF BLOOD  HARTMAN BENT OVER AND EXAMINED HER  AS FOR MYSELF I TURNED DEATHLY SICK  I WAS TO SEE MANY DEAD THAT DAY  BUT THE TOTALCARNAGE WAS NOT TO AFFECT ME AS DID THIS FIRST FORLORN BODY LYINGTHERE AT MY FEET ABANDONED ON THE PAVEMENT   SHOT IN THE BREAST   WASHARTMAN S REPORT  CLASPED IN THE HOLLOW OF HER ARM  AS A CHILD MIGHT BECLASPED  WAS A BUNDLE OF PRINTED MATTER  EVEN IN DEATH SHE SEEMED LOATHTO PART WITH THAT WHICH HAD CAUSED HER DEATH  FOR WHEN HARTMAN HADSUCCEEDED IN WITHDRAWING THE BUNDLE  WE FOUND THAT IT CONSISTED OF LARGEPRINTED SHEETS  THE PROCLAMATIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS  A COMRADE   I SAID BUT HARTMAN ONLY CURSED THE IRON HEEL  AND WE PASSED ON  OFTEN WEWERE HALTED BY THE POLICE AND PATROLS  BUT OUR PASSWORDS ENABLED USTO PROCEED  NO MORE BOMBS FELL FROM THE WINDOWS  THE LAST PEDESTRIANSSEEMED TO HAVE VANISHED FROM THE STREETS  AND OUR IMMEDIATE QUIETUDEGREW MORE PROFOUND  THOUGH THE GIGANTIC CALDRON CONTINUED TO BUBBLE INTHE DISTANCE  DULL ROARS OF EXPLOSIONS CAME TO US FROM ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE SMOKE PILLARS WERE TOWERING MORE OMINOUSLY IN THE HEAVENS CHAPTER XXIIITHE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSSSUDDENLY A CHANGE CAME OVER THE FACE OF THINGS  A TINGLE OF EXCITEMENTRAN ALONG THE AIR  AUTOMOBILES FLED PAST  TWO  THREE  A DOZEN  AND FROMTHEM WARNINGS WERE SHOUTED TO US  ONE OF THE MACHINES SWERVED WILDLYAT HIGH SPEED HALF A BLOCK DOWN  AND THE NEXT MOMENT  ALREADY LEFT WELLBEHIND IT  THE PAVEMENT WAS TORN INTO A GREAT HOLE BY A BURSTING BOMB WE SAW THE POLICE DISAPPEARING DOWN THE CROSS STREETS ON THE RUN  ANDKNEW THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS COMING  WE COULD HEAR THE RISING ROAROF IT  OUR BRAVE COMRADES ARE COMING   HARTMAN SAID WE COULD SEE THE FRONT OF THEIR COLUMN FILLING THE STREET FROM GUTTER TOGUTTER  AS THE LAST WAR AUTOMOBILE FLED PAST  THE MACHINE STOPPED FOR AMOMENT JUST ABREAST OF US  A SOLDIER LEAPED FROM IT  CARRYING SOMETHINGCAREFULLY IN HIS HANDS  THIS  WITH THE SAME CARE  HE DEPOSITED IN THEGUTTER  THEN HE LEAPED BACK TO HIS SEAT AND THE MACHINE DASHED ON  TOOKTHE TURN AT THE CORNER  AND WAS GONE FROM SIGHT  HARTMAN RAN TO THEGUTTER AND STOOPED OVER THE OBJECT  KEEP BACK   HE WARNED ME I COULD SEE HE WAS WORKING RAPIDLY WITH HIS HANDS  WHEN HE RETURNED TOME THE SWEAT WAS HEAVY ON HIS FOREHEAD  I DISCONNECTED IT   HE SAID   AND JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME  THE SOLDIERWAS CLUMSY  HE INTENDED IT FOR OUR COMRADES  BUT HE DIDN T GIVE ITENOUGH TIME  IT WOULD HAVE EXPLODED PREMATURELY  NOW IT WON T EXPLODE ATALL  EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING RAPIDLY NOW  ACROSS THE STREET AND HALF A BLOCKDOWN  HIGH UP IN A BUILDING  I COULD SEE HEADS PEERING OUT  I HAD JUSTPOINTED THEM OUT TO HARTMAN  WHEN A SHEET OF FLAME AND SMOKE RAN ALONGTHAT PORTION OF THE FACE OF THE BUILDING WHERE THE HEADS HAD APPEARED AND THE AIR WAS SHAKEN BY THE EXPLOSION  IN PLACES THE STONE FACING OFTHE BUILDING WAS TORN AWAY  EXPOSING THE IRON CONSTRUCTION BENEATH  THENEXT MOMENT SIMILAR SHEETS OF FLAME AND SMOKE SMOTE THE FRONT OF THEBUILDING ACROSS THE STREET OPPOSITE IT  BETWEEN THE EXPLOSIONS WE COULDHEAR THE RATTLE OF THE AUTOMATIC PISTOLS AND RIFLES  FOR SEVERAL MINUTESTHIS MID AIR BATTLE CONTINUED  THEN DIED OUT  IT WAS PATENT THAT OURCOMRADES WERE IN ONE BUILDING  THAT MERCENARIES WERE IN THE OTHER  ANDTHAT THEY WERE FIGHTING ACROSS THE STREET  BUT WE COULD NOT TELLWHICH WAS WHICH  WHICH BUILDING CONTAINED OUR COMRADES AND WHICH THEMERCENARIES BY THIS TIME THE COLUMN ON THE STREET WAS ALMOST ON US  AS THE FRONT OFIT PASSED UNDER THE WARRING BUILDINGS  BOTH WENT INTO ACTION AGAIN  ONEBUILDING DROPPING BOMBS INTO THE STREET  BEING ATTACKED FROM ACROSS THESTREET  AND IN RETURN REPLYING TO THAT ATTACK  THUS WE LEARNED WHICHBUILDING WAS HELD BY OUR COMRADES  AND THEY DID GOOD WORK  SAVING THOSEIN THE STREET FROM THE BOMBS OF THE ENEMY HARTMAN GRIPPED MY ARM AND DRAGGED ME INTO A WIDE ENTRANCE  THEY RE NOT OUR COMRADES   HE SHOUTED IN MY EAR THE INNER DOORS TO THE ENTRANCE WERE LOCKED AND BOLTED  WE COULD NOTESCAPE  THE NEXT MOMENT THE FRONT OF THE COLUMN WENT BY  IT WAS NOT ACOLUMN  BUT A MOB  AN AWFUL RIVER THAT FILLED THE STREET  THE PEOPLEOF THE ABYSS  MAD WITH DRINK AND WRONG  UP AT LAST AND ROARING FOR THEBLOOD OF THEIR MASTERS  I HAD SEEN THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS BEFORE  GONETHROUGH ITS GHETTOS  AND THOUGHT I KNEW IT  BUT I FOUND THAT I WAS NOWLOOKING ON IT FOR THE FIRST TIME  DUMB APATHY HAD VANISHED  IT WAS NOWDYNAMIC  A FASCINATING SPECTACLE OF DREAD  IT SURGED PAST MY VISION INCONCRETE WAVES OF WRATH  SNARLING AND GROWLING  CARNIVOROUS  DRUNK WITHWHISKEY FROM PILLAGED WAREHOUSES  DRUNK WITH HATRED  DRUNK WITH LUSTFOR BLOOD  MEN  WOMEN  AND CHILDREN  IN RAGS AND TATTERS  DIM FEROCIOUSINTELLIGENCES WITH ALL THE GODLIKE BLOTTED FROM THEIR FEATURES AND ALLTHE FIENDLIKE STAMPED IN  APES AND TIGERS  ANAEMIC CONSUMPTIVES ANDGREAT HAIRY BEASTS OF BURDEN  WAN FACES FROM WHICH

DEMONIACAL HORDE AND WHY NOT  THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS HAD NOTHING TO LOSE BUT THE MISERYAND PAIN OF LIVING  AND TO GAIN   NOTHING  SAVE ONE FINAL  AWFUL GLUT OFVENGEANCE  AND AS I LOOKED THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME THAT IN THAT RUSHINGSTREAM OF HUMAN LAVA WERE MEN  COMRADES AND HEROES  WHOSE MISSION HADBEEN TO ROUSE THE ABYSMAL BEAST AND TO KEEP THE ENEMY OCCUPIED IN COPINGWITH IT AND NOW A STRANGE THING HAPPENED TO ME  A TRANSFORMATION CAME OVER ME THE FEAR OF DEATH  FOR MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS  LEFT ME  I WAS STRANGELYEXALTED  ANOTHER BEING IN ANOTHER LIFE  NOTHING MATTERED  THE CAUSE FORTHIS ONE TIME WAS LOST  BUT THE CAUSE WOULD BE HERE TO MORROW  THESAME CAUSE  EVER FRESH AND EVER BURNING  AND THEREAFTER  IN THE ORGYOF HORROR THAT RAGED THROUGH THE SUCCEEDING HOURS  I WAS ABLE TO TAKEA CALM INTEREST  DEATH MEANT NOTHING  LIFE MEANT NOTHING  I WAS ANINTERESTED SPECTATOR OF EVENTS  AND  SOMETIMES SWEPT ON BY THE RUSH WAS MYSELF A CURIOUS PARTICIPANT  FOR MY MIND HAD LEAPED TO A STAR COOLALTITUDE AND GRASPED A PASSIONLESS TRANSVALUATION OF VALUES  HAD IT NOTDONE THIS  I KNOW THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED HALF A MILE OF THE MOB HAD SWEPT BY WHEN WE WERE DISCOVERED  A WOMANIN FANTASTIC

FORWARD AGAIN  DAZED AND HELPLESS THE BRANDISHED HATCHET FALLING FEEBLY ON HARTMAN S SHOULDER THE NEXT MOMENT I KNEW NOT WHAT WAS HAPPENING  I WAS OVERBORNE BY THECROWD  THE CONFINED SPACE WAS FILLED WITH SHRIEKS AND YELLS AND CURSES BLOWS WERE FALLING ON ME  HANDS WERE RIPPING AND TEARING AT MY FLESHAND GARMENTS  I FELT THAT I WAS BEING TORN TO PIECES  I WAS BEING BORNEDOWN  SUFFOCATED  SOME STRONG HAND GRIPPED MY SHOULDER IN THE THICK OFTHE PRESS AND WAS DRAGGING FIERCELY AT ME  BETWEEN PAIN AND PRESSURE IFAINTED  HARTMAN NEVER CAME OUT OF THAT ENTRANCE  HE HAD SHIELDED ME ANDRECEIVED THE FIRST BRUNT OF THE ATTACK  THIS HAD SAVED ME  FOR THE JAMHAD QUICKLY BECOME TOO DENSE FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN THE MAD GRIPPING ANDTEARING OF HANDS I CAME TO IN THE MIDST OF WILD MOVEMENT  ALL ABOUT ME WAS THE SAMEMOVEMENT  I HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN A MONSTROUS FLOOD THAT WAS SWEEPING MEI KNEW NOT WHITHER  FRESH AIR WAS ON MY CHEEK AND BITING SWEETLY IN MYLUNGS  FAINT AND DIZZY  I WAS VAGUELY AWARE OF A STRONG ARM AROUND MYBODY UNDER THE ARMS  AND HALF LIFTING ME AND DRAGGING ME ALONG  FEEBLYMY OWN LIMBS WERE HELPING ME  IN FRONT OF ME I COULD SEE THE MOVING BACKOF A MAN S COAT  IT HAD BEEN SLIT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM ALONG THE CENTRESEAM  AND IT PULSED RHYTHMICALLY  THE SLIT OPENING AND CLOSING REGULARLYWITH EVERY LEAP OF THE WEARER  THIS PHENOMENON FASCINATED ME FOR A TIME WHILE MY SENSES WERE COMING BACK TO ME  NEXT I BECAME AWARE OF STINGINGCHEEKS AND NOSE  AND COULD FEEL BLOOD DRIPPING ON MY FACE  MY HAT WASGONE  MY HAIR WAS DOWN AND FLYING  AND FROM THE STINGING OF THE SCALP IMANAGED TO RECOLLECT A HAND IN THE PRESS OF THE ENTRANCE THAT HAD TORNAT MY HAIR  MY CHEST AND ARMS WERE BRUISED AND ACHING IN A SCORE OFPLACES MY BRAIN GREW CLEARER  AND I TURNED AS I RAN AND LOOKED AT THE MAN WHOWAS HOLDING ME UP  HE IT WAS WHO HAD DRAGGED ME OUT AND SAVED ME  HENOTICED MY MOVEMENT  IT S ALL RIGHT   HE SHOUTED HOARSELY   I KNEW YOU ON THE INSTANT  I FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HIM  BUT BEFORE I COULD SPEAK I TROD UPONSOMETHING THAT WAS ALIVE AND THAT SQUIRMED UNDER MY FOOT  I WAS SWEPT ONBY THOSE BEHIND AND COULD NOT LOOK DOWN AND SEE  AND YET I KNEW THAT ITWAS A WOMAN WHO HAD FALLEN AND WHO WAS BEING TRAMPLED INTO THE PAVEMENTBY THOUSANDS OF SUCCESSIVE FEET  IT S ALL RIGHT   HE REPEATED   I M GARTHWAITE  HE WAS BEARDED AND GAUNT AND DIRTY  BUT I SUCCEEDED IN REMEMBERING HIMAS THE STALWART YOUTH THAT HAD SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN OUR GLEN ELLENREFUGE THREE YEARS BEFORE  HE PASSED ME THE SIGNALS OF THE IRON HEEL SSECRET SERVICE  IN TOKEN THAT HE  TOO  WAS IN ITS EMPLOY  I LL GET YOU OUT OF THIS AS SOON AS I CAN GET A CHANCE   HE ASSURED ME  BUT WATCH YOUR FOOTING  ON YOUR LIFE DON T STUMBLE AND GO DOWN  ALL THINGS HAPPENED ABRUPTLY ON THAT DAY  AND WITH AN ABRUPTNESS THATWAS SICKENING THE MOB CHECKED ITSELF  I CAME IN VIOLENT COLLISION WITHA LARGE WOMAN IN FRONT OF ME  THE MAN WITH THE SPLIT COAT HAD VANISHED  WHILE THOSE BEHIND COLLIDED AGAINST ME  A DEVILISH PANDEMONIUMREIGNED   SHRIEKS  CURSES  AND CRIES OF DEATH  WHILE ABOVE ALL ROSE THECHURNING RATTLE OF MACHINE GUNS AND THE PUT A PUT  PUT A PUT OF RIFLES AT FIRST I COULD MAKE OUT NOTHING  PEOPLE WERE FALLING ABOUT ME RIGHTAND LEFT  THE WOMAN IN FRONT DOUBLED UP AND WENT DOWN  HER HANDS ON HERABDOMEN IN A FRENZIED CLUTCH  A MAN WAS QUIVERING AGAINST MY LEGS IN ADEATH STRUGGLE IT CAME TO ME THAT WE WERE AT THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN  HALF A MILE OF ITHAD DISAPPEARED  WHERE OR HOW I NEVER LEARNED  TO THIS DAY I DO NOT KNOWWHAT BECAME OF THAT HALF MILE OF HUMANITY  WHETHER IT WAS BLOTTED OUTBY SOME FRIGHTFUL BOLT OF WAR  WHETHER IT WAS SCATTERED AND DESTROYEDPIECEMEAL  OR WHETHER IT ESCAPED  BUT THERE WE WERE  AT THE HEAD OF THECOLUMN INSTEAD OF IN ITS MIDDLE  AND WE WERE BEING SWEPT OUT OF LIFE BYA TORRENT OF SHRIEKING LEAD AS SOON AS DEATH HAD THINNED THE JAM  GARTHWAITE  STILL GRASPING MY ARM LED A RUSH OF SURVIVORS INTO THE WIDE ENTRANCE OF AN OFFICE BUILDING HERE  AT THE REAR  AGAINST THE DOORS  WE WERE PRESSED BY A PANTING GASPING MASS OF CREATURES  FOR SOME TIME WE REMAINED IN THIS POSITIONWITHOUT A CHANGE IN THE SITUATION  I DID IT BEAUTIFULLY   GARTHWAITE WAS LAMENTING TO ME   RAN YOU RIGHTINTO A TRAP  WE HAD A GAMBLER S CHANCE IN THE STREET  BUT IN HERETHERE IS NO CHANCE AT ALL  IT S ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTING  VIVE LAREVOLUTION  THEN  WHAT HE EXPECTED  BEGAN  THE MERCENARIES WERE KILLING WITHOUTQUARTER  AT FIRST  THE SURGE BACK UPON US WAS CRUSHING  BUT AS THEKILLING CONTINUED THE PRESSURE WAS EASED  THE DEAD AND DYING WENT DOWNAND MADE ROOM  GARTHWAITE PUT HIS MOUTH TO MY EAR AND SHOUTED  BUT INTHE FRIGHTFUL DIN I COULD NOT CATCH WHAT HE SAID  HE DID NOT WAIT  HESEIZED ME AND THREW ME DOWN  NEXT HE DRAGGED A DYING WOMAN OVER ON TOPOF ME  AND  WITH MUCH SQUEEZING AND SHOVING  CRAWLED IN BESIDE ME ANDPARTLY OVER ME  A MOUND OF DEAD AND DYING BEGAN TO PILE UP OVER US  ANDOVER THIS MOUND  PAWING AND MOANING  CREPT THOSE THAT STILL SURVIVED BUT THESE  TOO  SOON CEASED  AND A SEMI SILENCE SETTLED DOWN  BROKEN BYGROANS AND SOBS AND SOUNDS OF STRANGULATION I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CRUSHED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR GARTHWAITE  AS IT WAS IT SEEMED INCONCEIVABLE THAT I COULD BEAR THE WEIGHT I DID AND LIVE  ANDYET  OUTSIDE OF PAIN  THE ONLY FEELING I POSSESSED WAS ONE OF CURIOSITY HOW WAS IT GOING TO END  WHAT WOULD DEATH BE LIKE  THUS DID I RECEIVEMY RED BAPTISM IN THAT CHICAGO SHAMBLES  PRIOR TO THAT  DEATH TO ME HADBEEN A THEORY  BUT EVER AFTERWARD DEATH HAS BEEN A SIMPLE FACT THAT DOESNOT MATTER  IT IS SO EASY BUT THE MERCENARIES WERE NOT CONTENT WITH WHAT THEY HAD DONE  THEYINVADED THE ENTRANCE  KILLING THE WOUNDED AND SEARCHING OUT THE UNHURTTHAT  LIKE OURSELVES  WERE PLAYING DEAD  I REMEMBER ONE MAN THEY DRAGGEDOUT OF A HEAP  WHO PLEADED ABJECTLY UNTIL A REVOLVER SHOT CUT HIM SHORT THEN THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO CHARGED FROM A HEAP  SNARLING AND SHOOTING SHE FIRED SIX SHOTS BEFORE THEY GOT HER  THOUGH WHAT DAMAGE SHE DID WECOULD NOT KNOW  WE COULD FOLLOW THESE TRAGEDIES ONLY BY THE SOUND  EVERYLITTLE WHILE FLURRIES LIKE THIS OCCURRED  EACH FLURRY CULMINATING IN THEREVOLVER SHOT THAT PUT AN END TO IT  IN THE INTERVALS WE COULD HEARTHE SOLDIERS TALKING AND SWEARING AS THEY RUMMAGED AMONG THE CARCASSES URGED ON BY THEIR OFFICERS TO HURRY UP AT LAST THEY WENT TO WORK ON OUR HEAP  AND WE COULD FEEL THE PRESSUREDIMINISH AS THEY DRAGGED AWAY THE DEAD AND WOUNDED  GARTHWAITE BEGANUTTERING ALOUD THE SIGNALS  AT FIRST HE WAS NOT HEARD  THEN HE RAISEDHIS VOICE  LISTEN TO THAT   WE HEARD A SOLDIER SAY  AND NEXT THE SHARP VOICE OF ANOFFICER   HOLD ON THERE  CAREFUL AS YOU GO  OH  THAT FIRST BREATH OF AIR AS WE WERE DRAGGED OUT  GARTHWAITE DID THETALKING AT FIRST  BUT I WAS COMPELLED TO UNDERGO A BRIEF EXAMINATION TOPROVE SERVICE WITH THE IRON HEEL  AGENTS PROVOCATEURS ALL RIGHT   WAS THE OFFICER S CONCLUSION  HE WASA BEARDLESS YOUNG FELLOW  A CADET  EVIDENTLY  OF SOME GREAT OLIGARCHFAMILY  IT S A HELL OF A JOB   GARTHWAITE GRUMBLED   I M GOING TO TRY ANDRESIGN AND GET INTO THE ARMY  YOU FELLOWS HAVE A SNAP   YOU VE EARNED IT   WAS THE YOUNG OFFICER S ANSWER   I VE GOT SOME PULL AND I LL SEE IF IT CAN BE MANAGED  I CAN TELL THEM HOW I FOUND YOU  HE TOOK GARTHWAITE S NAME AND NUMBER  THEN TURNED TO ME  AND YOU   OH  I M GOING TO BE MARRIED   I ANSWERED LIGHTLY   AND THEN I LL BE OUTOF IT ALL  AND SO WE TALKED  WHILE THE KILLING OF THE WOUNDED WENT ON  IT IS ALLA DREAM  NOW  AS I LOOK BACK ON IT  BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS THE MOSTNATURAL THING IN THE WORLD  GARTHWAITE AND THE YOUNG OFFICER FELL INTOAN ANIMATED CONVERSATION OVER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SO CALLED MODERNWARFARE AND THE PRESENT STREET FIGHTING AND SKY SCRAPER FIGHTING THATWAS TAKING PLACE ALL OVER THE CITY  I FOLLOWED THEM INTENTLY  FIXING UPMY HAIR AT THE SAME TIME AND PINNING TOGETHER MY TORN SKIRTS  AND ALLTHE TIME THE KILLING OF THE WOUNDED WENT ON  SOMETIMES THE REVOLVERSHOTS DROWNED THE VOICES OF GARTHWAITE AND THE OFFICER  AND THEY WERECOMPELLED TO REPEAT WHAT THEY HAD BEEN SAYING I LIVED THROUGH THREE DAYS OF THE CHICAGO COMMUNE  AND THE VASTNESS OFIT AND OF THE SLAUGHTER MAY BE IMAGINED WHEN I SAY THAT IN ALL THAT TIMEI SAW PRACTICALLY NOTHING OUTSIDE THE KILLING OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSSAND THE MID AIR FIGHTING BETWEEN SKY SCRAPERS  I REALLY SAW NOTHING OFTHE HEROIC WORK DONE BY THE COMRADES  I COULD HEAR THE EXPLOSIONS OFTHEIR MINES AND BOMBS  AND SEE THE SMOKE OF THEIR CONFLAGRATIONS  ANDTHAT WAS ALL  THE MID AIR PART OF ONE GREAT DEED I SAW  HOWEVER  ANDTHAT WAS THE BALLOON ATTACKS MADE BY OUR COMRADES ON THE FORTRESSES THAT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY  THE THREE DISLOYAL REGIMENTS HAD BEENDESTROYED IN THE FORTRESSES TO THE LAST MAN  THE FORTRESSES WERE CROWDEDWITH MERCENARIES  THE WIND BLEW IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION  AND UP WENT OURBALLOONS FROM ONE OF THE OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE CITY NOW BIEDENBACH  AFTER HE LEFT GLEN ELLEN  HAD INVENTED A MOST POWERFULEXPLOSIVE   EXPEDITE  HE CALLED IT  THIS WAS THE WEAPON THE BALLOONSUSED  THEY WERE ONLY HOT AIR BALLOONS  CLUMSILY AND HASTILY MADE  BUTTHEY DID THE WORK  I SAW IT ALL FROM THE TOP OF AN OFFICE BUILDING  THEFIRST BALLOON MISSED THE FORTRESSES COMPLETELY AND DISAPPEARED INTO THECOUNTRY  BUT WE LEARNED ABOUT IT AFTERWARD  BURTON AND O SULLIVAN WEREIN IT  AS THEY WERE DESCENDING THEY SWEPT ACROSS A RAILROAD DIRECTLYOVER A TROOP TRAIN THAT WAS HEADING AT FULL SPEED FOR CHICAGO  THEYDROPPED THEIR WHOLE SUPPLY OF EXPEDITE UPON THE LOCOMOTIVE  THERESULTING WRECK TIED THE LINE UP FOR DAYS  AND THE BEST OF IT WAS THAT RELEASED FROM THE WEIGHT OF EXPEDITE  THE BALLOON SHOT UP INTO THEAIR AND DID NOT COME DOWN FOR HALF A DOZEN MILES  BOTH HEROES ESCAPINGUNHARMED THE SECOND BALLOON WAS A FAILURE  ITS FLIGHT WAS LAME  IT FLOATED TOOLOW AND WAS SHOT FULL OF HOLES BEFORE IT COULD REACH THE FORTRESSES HERFORD AND GUINNESS WERE IN IT  AND THEY WERE BLOWN TO PIECES ALONGWITH THE FIELD INTO WHICH THEY FELL  BIEDENBACH WAS IN DESPAIR  WE HEARDALL ABOUT IT AFTERWARD  AND HE WENT UP ALONE IN THE THIRD BALLOON  HE TOO  MADE A LOW FLIGHT  BUT HE WAS IN LUCK  FOR THEY FAILED SERIOUSLY TOPUNCTURE HIS BALLOON  I CAN SEE IT NOW AS I DID THEN  FROM THE LOFTY TOPOF THE BUILDING  THAT INFLATED BAG DRIFTING ALONG THE AIR  AND THAT TINYSPECK OF A MAN CLINGING ON BENEATH  I COULD NOT SEE THE FORTRESS  BUTTHOSE ON THE ROOF WITH ME SAID HE WAS DIRECTLY OVER IT  I DID NOTSEE THE EXPEDITE FALL WHEN HE CUT IT LOOSE  BUT I DID SEE THE BALLOONSUDDENLY LEAP UP INTO THE SKY  AN APPRECIABLE TIME AFTER THAT THE GREATCOLUMN OF THE EXPLOSION TOWERED IN THE AIR  AND AFTER THAT  IN TURN  IHEARD THE ROAR OF IT  BIEDENBACH THE GENTLE HAD DESTROYED A FORTRESS TWO OTHER BALLOONS FOLLOWED AT THE SAME TIME  ONE WAS BLOWN TO PIECESIN THE AIR  THE EXPEDITE EXPLODING  AND THE SHOCK OF IT DISRUPTED THESECOND BALLOON  WHICH FELL PRETTILY INTO THE REMAINING FORTRESS IT COULDN T HAVE BEEN BETTER PLANNED  THOUGH THE TWO COMRADES IN ITSACRIFICED THEIR LIVES BUT TO RETURN TO THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  MY EXPERIENCES WERE CONFINEDTO THEM  THEY RAGED AND SLAUGHTERED AND DESTROYED ALL OVER THE CITYPROPER  AND WERE IN TURN DESTROYED  BUT NEVER ONCE DID THEY SUCCEED INREACHING THE CITY OF THE OLIGARCHS OVER ON THE WEST SIDE  THE OLIGARCHSHAD PROTECTED THEMSELVES WELL  NO MATTER WHAT DESTRUCTION WAS WREAKED INTHE HEART OF THE CITY  THEY  AND THEIR WOMENKIND AND CHILDREN  WERE TOESCAPE HURT  I AM TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN PLAYED IN THE PARKS DURINGTHOSE TERRIBLE DAYS AND THAT THEIR FAVORITE GAME WAS AN IMITATION OFTHEIR ELDERS STAMPING UPON THE PROLETARIAT BUT THE MERCENARIES FOUND IT NO EASY TASK TO COPE WITH THE PEOPLE OF THEABYSS AND AT THE SAME TIME FIGHT WITH THE COMRADES  CHICAGO WAS TRUE TOHER TRADITIONS  AND THOUGH A GENERATION OF REVOLUTIONISTS WAS WIPED OUT IT TOOK ALONG WITH IT PRETTY CLOSE TO A GENERATION OF ITS ENEMIES OF COURSE  THE IRON HEEL KEPT THE FIGURES SECRET  BUT  AT A VERYCONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE  AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSANDMERCENARIES WERE SLAIN  BUT THE COMRADES HAD NO CHANCE  INSTEAD OF THEWHOLE COUNTRY BEING HAND IN HAND IN REVOLT  THEY WERE ALL ALONE  AND THETOTAL STRENGTH OF THE OLIGARCHY COULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED AGAINST THEMIF NECESSARY  AS IT WAS  HOUR AFTER HOUR  DAY AFTER DAY  IN ENDLESSTRAIN LOADS  BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  THE MERCENARIES WERE HURLED INTOCHICAGO AND THERE WERE SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  TIRING OF THESLAUGHTER  A GREAT HERDING MOVEMENT WAS BEGUN BY THE SOLDIERS  THEINTENT OF WHICH WAS TO DRIVE THE STREET MOBS  LIKE CATTLE  INTO LAKEMICHIGAN  IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MOVEMENT THAT GARTHWAITE AND IHAD ENCOUNTERED THE YOUNG OFFICER  THIS HERDING MOVEMENT WAS PRACTICALLYA FAILURE  THANKS TO THE SPLENDID WORK OF THE COMRADES  INSTEAD OF THEGREAT HOST THE MERCENARIES HAD HOPED TO GATHER TOGETHER  THEY SUCCEEDEDIN DRIVING NO MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND OF THE WRETCHES INTO THE LAKE TIME AND AGAIN  WHEN A MOB OF THEM WAS WELL IN HAND AND BEING DRIVENALONG THE STREETS TO THE WATER  THE COMRADES WOULD CREATE A DIVERSION AND THE MOB WOULD ESCAPE THROUGH THE CONSEQUENT HOLE TORN IN THEENCIRCLING NET GARTHWAITE AND I SAW AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SHORTLY AFTER MEETING WITH THEYOUNG OFFICER  THE MOB OF WHICH WE HAD BEEN A PART  AND WHICH HAD BEENPUT IN RETREAT  WAS PREVENTED FROM ESCAPING TO THE SOUTH AND EAST BYSTRONG BODIES OF TROOPS  THE TROOPS WE HAD FALLEN IN WITH HAD HELD ITBACK ON THE WEST  THE ONLY OUTLET WAS NORTH  AND NORTH IT WENT TOWARDTHE LAKE  DRIVEN ON FROM EAST AND WEST AND SOUTH BY MACHINE GUN FIRE ANDAUTOMATICS  WHETHER IT DIVINED THAT IT WAS BEING DRIVEN TOWARD THE LAKE OR WHETHER IT WAS MERELY A BLIND SQUIRM OF THE MONSTER  I DO NOT KNOW BUT AT ANY RATE THE MOB TOOK A CROSS STREET TO THE WEST  TURNED DOWNTHE NEXT STREET  AND CAME BACK UPON ITS TRACK  HEADING SOUTH TOWARD THEGREAT GHETTO GARTHWAITE AND I AT THAT TIME WERE TRYING TO MAKE OUR WAY WESTWARD TOGET OUT OF THE TERRITORY OF STREET FIGHTING  AND WE WERE CAUGHT RIGHT INTHE THICK OF IT AGAIN  AS WE CAME TO THE CORNER WE SAW THE HOWLING MOBBEARING DOWN UPON US  GARTHWAITE SEIZED MY ARM AND WE WERE JUST STARTINGTO RUN  WHEN HE DRAGGED ME BACK FROM IN FRONT OF THE WHEELS OF HALF ADOZEN WAR AUTOMOBILES  EQUIPPED WITH MACHINE GUNS  THAT WERE RUSHING FORTHE SPOT  BEHIND THEM CAME THE SOLDIERS WITH THEIR AUTOMATIC RIFLES BY THE TIME THEY TOOK POSITION  THE MOB WAS UPON THEM  AND IT LOOKED ASTHOUGH THEY WOULD BE OVERWHELMED BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO ACTION HERE AND THERE A SOLDIER WAS DISCHARGING HIS RIFLE  BUT THIS SCATTEREDFIRE HAD NO EFFECT IN CHECKING THE MOB  ON IT CAME  BELLOWING WITH BRUTERAGE  IT SEEMED THE MACHINE GUNS COULD NOT GET STARTED  THE AUTOMOBILESON WHICH THEY WERE MOUNTED BLOCKED THE STREET  COMPELLING THE SOLDIERSTO FIND

ITSWILD ATTEMPT TO BREAK THROUGH  ORDERS WERE BEING GIVEN TO CLEAR THEWHEELS OF THE WAR MACHINES  THEY COULD NOT ADVANCE OVER THAT WAVE OFDEAD  AND THE IDEA WAS TO RUN THEM DOWN THE CROSS STREET  THE

WRONG DIRECTION  BUT WE LL GET OUT SOMEHOW  AND WE FLED EASTWARD THROUGH THE QUIET STREETS  PREPARED AT EVERY CROSSSTREET FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN  TO THE SOUTH A MONSTER CONFLAGRATION WASFILLING THE SKY  AND WE KNEW THAT THE GREAT GHETTO WAS BURNING  AT LASTI SANK DOWN ON THE SIDEWALK  I WAS EXHAUSTED AND COULD GO NO FARTHER I WAS BRUISED AND SORE AND ACHING IN EVERY LIMB  YET I COULD NOT

SPLITTING HEADACHE WAS COMING ON  AND I WAS ONLY TOO GLADTO CLOSE MY EYES AND TRY TO SLEEP  I LL BE BACK   WERE HIS PARTING WORDS   I DON T HOPE TO GET AN AUTO BUT I LL SURELY BRING SOME GRUB   ANYWAY         FOOD AND THAT WAS THE LAST I SAW OF GARTHWAITE FOR THREE YEARS  INSTEAD OFCOMING BACK  HE WAS CARRIED AWAY TO A HOSPITAL WITH A BULLET THROUGH HISLUNGS AND ANOTHER THROUGH THE FLESHY PART OF HIS NECK CHAPTER XXIVNIGHTMAREI HAD NOT CLOSED MY EYES THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY  ANDWHAT OF THAT AND OF MY EXHAUSTION I SLEPT SOUNDLY  WHEN I FIRST AWOKE IT WAS NIGHT  GARTHWAITE HAD NOT RETURNED  I HAD LOST MY WATCH AND HADNO IDEA OF THE TIME  AS I LAY WITH MY EYES CLOSED  I HEARD THE SAMEDULL SOUND OF DISTANT EXPLOSIONS  THE INFERNO WAS STILL RAGING  I CREPTTHROUGH THE STORE TO THE FRONT  THE REFLECTION FROM THE SKY OF VASTCONFLAGRATIONS MADE THE STREET ALMOST AS LIGHT AS DAY  ONE COULD HAVEREAD THE FINEST PRINT WITH EASE  FROM SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY CAME THECRACKLE OF SMALL HAND BOMBS AND THE CHURNING OF MACHINE GUNS  AND FROM ALONG WAY OFF CAME A LONG SERIES OF HEAVY EXPLOSIONS  I CREPT BACK TO MYHORSE BLANKETS AND SLEPT AGAIN WHEN NEXT I AWOKE  A SICKLY YELLOW LIGHT WAS FILTERING IN ON ME  IT WASDAWN OF THE SECOND DAY  I CREPT TO THE FRONT OF THE STORE  A SMOKE PALL SHOT THROUGH WITH LURID GLEAMS  FILLED THE SKY  DOWN THE OPPOSITESIDE OF THE STREET TOTTERED A WRETCHED SLAVE  ONE HAND HE HELD TIGHTLYAGAINST HIS SIDE  AND BEHIND HIM HE LEFT A BLOODY TRAIL  HIS EYES ROVEDEVERYWHERE  AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH APPREHENSION AND DREAD  ONCE HELOOKED STRAIGHT ACROSS AT ME  AND IN HIS FACE WAS ALL THE DUMB PATHOSOF THE WOUNDED AND HUNTED ANIMAL  HE SAW ME  BUT THERE WAS NO KINSHIPBETWEEN US  AND WITH HIM  AT LEAST  NO SYMPATHY OF UNDERSTANDING  FORHE COWERED PERCEPTIBLY AND DRAGGED HIMSELF ON  HE COULD EXPECT NO AIDIN ALL GOD S WORLD  HE WAS A HELOT IN THE GREAT HUNT OF HELOTS THAT THEMASTERS WERE MAKING  ALL HE COULD HOPE FOR  ALL HE SOUGHT  WAS SOME HOLETO CRAWL AWAY IN AND HIDE LIKE ANY ANIMAL  THE SHARP CLANG OF A PASSINGAMBULANCE AT THE CORNER GAVE HIM A START  AMBULANCES WERE NOT FOR SUCHAS HE  WITH A GROAN OF PAIN HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A DOORWAY  A MINUTELATER HE WAS OUT AGAIN AND DESPERATELY HOBBLING ON I WENT BACK TO MY HORSE BLANKETS AND WAITED AN HOUR FOR GARTHWAITE  MYHEADACHE HAD NOT GONE AWAY  ON THE CONTRARY  IT WAS INCREASING  IT WASBY AN EFFORT OF WILL ONLY THAT I WAS ABLE TO OPEN MY EYES AND LOOKAT OBJECTS  AND WITH THE OPENING OF MY EYES AND THE LOOKING CAMEINTOLERABLE TORMENT  ALSO  A GREAT PULSE WAS BEATING IN MY BRAIN  WEAKAND REELING  I WENT OUT THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW AND DOWN THE STREET SEEKING TO ESCAPE  INSTINCTIVELY AND GROPINGLY  FROM THE AWFUL SHAMBLES AND THEREAFTER I LIVED NIGHTMARE  MY MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THESUCCEEDING HOURS IS THE MEMORY ONE WOULD HAVE OF NIGHTMARE  MANY EVENTSARE FOCUSSED SHARPLY ON MY BRAIN  BUT BETWEEN THESE INDELIBLE PICTURESI RETAIN ARE INTERVALS OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS  WHAT OCCURRED IN THOSEINTERVALS I KNOW NOT  AND NEVER SHALL KNOW I REMEMBER STUMBLING AT THE CORNER OVER THE LEGS OF A MAN  IT WAS THEPOOR HUNTED WRETCH THAT HAD DRAGGED HIMSELF PAST MY HIDING PLACE  HOWDISTINCTLY DO I REMEMBER HIS POOR  PITIFUL  GNARLED HANDS AS HE LAYTHERE ON THE PAVEMENT  HANDS THAT WERE MORE HOOF AND CLAW THAN HANDS ALL TWISTED AND DISTORTED BY THE TOIL OF ALL HIS DAYS  WITH ON THE PALMSA HORNY GROWTH OF CALLOUS A HALF INCH THICK  AND AS I PICKED MYSELFUP AND STARTED ON  I LOOKED INTO THE FACE OF THE THING AND SAW THAT ITSTILL LIVED  FOR THE EYES  DIMLY INTELLIGENT  WERE LOOKING AT ME ANDSEEING ME AFTER THAT CAME A KINDLY BLANK  I KNEW NOTHING  SAW NOTHING  MERELYTOTTERED ON IN MY QUEST FOR SAFETY  MY NEXT NIGHTMARE VISION WAS AQUIET STREET OF THE DEAD  I CAME UPON IT ABRUPTLY  AS A WANDERER IN THECOUNTRY WOULD COME UPON A FLOWING STREAM  ONLY THIS STREAM I GAZED UPONDID NOT FLOW  IT WAS CONGEALED IN DEATH  FROM PAVEMENT TO PAVEMENT  ANDCOVERING THE SIDEWALKS  IT LAY THERE  SPREAD OUT QUITE EVENLY  WITHONLY HERE AND THERE A LUMP OR MOUND OF BODIES TO BREAK THE SURFACE  POORDRIVEN PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  HUNTED HELOTS  THEY LAY THERE AS THE RABBITSIN CALIFORNIA AFTER A DRIVE   UP THE STREET AND DOWN I LOOKED  THERE WASNO MOVEMENT  NO SOUND  THE QUIET BUILDINGS LOOKED DOWN UPON THE SCENEFROM THEIR MANY WINDOWS  AND ONCE  AND ONCE ONLY  I SAW AN ARM THATMOVED IN THAT DEAD STREAM  I SWEAR I SAW IT MOVE  WITH A STRANGEWRITHING GESTURE OF AGONY  AND WITH IT LIFTED A HEAD  GORY WITH NAMELESSHORROR  THAT GIBBERED AT ME AND THEN LAY DOWN AGAIN AND MOVED NO MORE        IN THOSE DAYS  SO SPARSELY POPULATED WAS THE LAND THAT     WILD ANIMALS OFTEN BECAME PESTS   IN CALIFORNIA THE CUSTOM     OF RABBIT DRIVING OBTAINED   ON A GIVEN DAY ALL THE FARMERS     IN A LOCALITY WOULD ASSEMBLE AND SWEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN     CONVERGING LINES  DRIVING THE RABBITS BY SCORES OF THOUSANDS     INTO A PREPARED ENCLOSURE  WHERE THEY WERE CLUBBED TO DEATH     BY MEN AND BOYS I REMEMBER ANOTHER STREET  WITH QUIET BUILDINGS ON EITHER SIDE  AND THEPANIC THAT SMOTE ME INTO CONSCIOUSNESS AS AGAIN I SAW THE PEOPLE OF THEABYSS  BUT THIS TIME IN A STREAM THAT FLOWED AND CAME ON  AND THEN I SAWTHERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR  THE STREAM MOVED SLOWLY  WHILE FROM IT AROSEGROANS AND LAMENTATIONS  CURSINGS  BABBLINGS OF SENILITY  HYSTERIA  ANDINSANITY  FOR THESE WERE THE VERY YOUNG AND THE VERY OLD  THE FEEBLE ANDTHE SICK  THE HELPLESS AND THE HOPELESS  ALL THE WRECKAGE OF THE GHETTO THE BURNING OF THE GREAT GHETTO ON THE SOUTH SIDE HAD DRIVEN THEM FORTHINTO THE INFERNO OF THE STREET FIGHTING  AND WHITHER THEY WENDED ANDWHATEVER BECAME OF THEM I DID NOT KNOW AND NEVER LEARNED         IT WAS LONG A QUESTION OF DEBATE  WHETHER THE BURNING OF     THE SOUTH SIDE GHETTO WAS ACCIDENTAL  OR WHETHER IT WAS DONE     BY THE MERCENARIES  BUT IT IS DEFINITELY SETTLED NOW THAT     THE GHETTO WAS FIRED BY THE MERCENARIES UNDER ORDERS FROM     THEIR CHIEFS I HAVE FAINT MEMORIES OF BREAKING A WINDOW AND HIDING IN SOME SHOP TOESCAPE A STREET MOB THAT WAS PURSUED BY SOLDIERS  ALSO  A BOMB BURSTNEAR ME  ONCE  IN SOME STILL STREET  WHERE  LOOK AS I WOULD  UP ANDDOWN  I COULD SEE NO HUMAN BEING  BUT MY NEXT SHARP RECOLLECTION BEGINSWITH THE CRACK OF A RIFLE AND AN ABRUPT BECOMING AWARE THAT I AM BEINGFIRED AT BY A SOLDIER IN AN AUTOMOBILE  THE SHOT MISSED  AND THE NEXTMOMENT I WAS SCREAMING AND MOTIONING THE SIGNALS  MY MEMORY OF RIDING INTHE AUTOMOBILE IS VERY HAZY  THOUGH THIS RIDE  IN TURN  IS BROKEN BY ONEVIVID PICTURE  THE CRACK OF THE RIFLE OF THE SOLDIER SITTING BESIDE MEMADE ME OPEN MY EYES  AND I SAW GEORGE MILFORD  WHOM I HAD KNOWN IN THEPELL STREET DAYS  SINKING SLOWLY DOWN TO THE SIDEWALK  EVEN AS HE SANKTHE SOLDIER FIRED AGAIN  AND MILFORD DOUBLED IN  THEN FLUNG HIS BODYOUT  AND FELL SPRAWLING  THE SOLDIER CHUCKLED  AND THE AUTOMOBILE SPEDON THE NEXT I KNEW AFTER THAT I WAS AWAKENED OUT OF A SOUND SLEEP BY A MANWHO WALKED UP AND DOWN CLOSE BESIDE ME  HIS FACE WAS DRAWN AND STRAINED AND THE SWEAT ROLLED DOWN HIS NOSE FROM HIS FOREHEAD  ONE HAND WASCLUTCHED TIGHTLY AGAINST HIS CHEST BY THE OTHER HAND  AND BLOODDRIPPED DOWN UPON THE FLOOR AS HE WALKED  HE WORE THE UNIFORM OF THEMERCENARIES  FROM WITHOUT  AS THROUGH THICK WALLS  CAME THE MUFFLED ROAROF BURSTING BOMBS  I WAS IN SOME BUILDING THAT WAS LOCKED IN COMBAT WITHSOME OTHER BUILDING A SURGEON CAME IN TO DRESS THE WOUNDED SOLDIER  AND I LEARNED THAT ITWAS TWO IN THE AFTERNOON  MY HEADACHE WAS NO BETTER  AND THE SURGEONPAUSED FROM HIS WORK LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A POWERFUL DRUG THAT WOULDDEPRESS THE HEART AND BRING RELIEF  I SLEPT AGAIN  AND THE NEXT I KNEW IWAS ON TOP OF THE BUILDING  THE IMMEDIATE FIGHTING HAD CEASED  AND IWAS WATCHING THE BALLOON ATTACK ON THE FORTRESSES  SOME ONE HAD AN ARMAROUND ME AND I WAS LEANING CLOSE AGAINST HIM  IT CAME TO ME QUITE AS AMATTER OF COURSE THAT THIS WAS ERNEST  AND I FOUND MYSELF WONDERING HOWHE HAD GOT HIS HAIR AND EYEBROWS SO BADLY SINGED IT WAS BY THE MEREST CHANCE THAT WE HAD FOUND EACH OTHER IN THATTERRIBLE CITY  HE HAD HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD LEFT NEW YORK  AND  COMINGTHROUGH THE ROOM WHERE I LAY ASLEEP  COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE THATIT WAS I  LITTLE MORE I SAW OF THE CHICAGO COMMUNE  AFTER WATCHING THEBALLOON ATTACK  ERNEST TOOK ME DOWN INTO THE HEART OF THE BUILDING WHERE I SLEPT THE AFTERNOON OUT AND THE NIGHT  THE THIRD DAY WE SPENTIN THE BUILDING  AND ON THE FOURTH  ERNEST HAVING GOT PERMISSION AND ANAUTOMOBILE FROM THE AUTHORITIES  WE LEFT CHICAGO MY HEADACHE WAS GONE  BUT  BODY AND SOUL  I WAS VERY TIRED  I LAY BACKAGAINST ERNEST IN THE AUTOMOBILE  AND WITH APATHETIC EYES WATCHED THESOLDIERS TRYING TO GET THE MACHINE OUT OF THE CITY  FIGHTING WASSTILL GOING ON  BUT ONLY IN ISOLATED LOCALITIES  HERE AND THERE WHOLEDISTRICTS WERE STILL IN POSSESSION OF THE COMRADES  BUT SUCH DISTRICTSWERE SURROUNDED AND GUARDED BY HEAVY BODIES OF TROOPS  IN A HUNDREDSEGREGATED TRAPS WERE THE COMRADES THUS HELD WHILE THE WORK OFSUBJUGATING THEM WENT ON  SUBJUGATION MEANT DEATH  FOR NO QUARTER WASGIVEN  AND THEY FOUGHT HEROICALLY TO THE LAST MAN         NUMBERS OF THE BUILDINGS HELD OUT OVER A WEEK  WHILE ONE     HELD OUT ELEVEN DAYS   EACH BUILDING HAD TO BE STORMED LIKE     A FORT  AND THE MERCENARIES FOUGHT THEIR WAY UPWARD FLOOR BY     FLOOR   IT WAS DEADLY FIGHTING   QUARTER WAS NEITHER GIVEN     NOR TAKEN  AND IN THE FIGHTING THE REVOLUTIONISTS HAD THE     ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABOVE   WHILE THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE     WIPED OUT  THE LOSS WAS NOT ONE SIDED   THE PROUD CHICAGO     PROLETARIAT LIVED UP TO ITS ANCIENT BOAST   FOR AS MANY OF     ITSELF AS WERE KILLED  IT KILLED THAT MANY OF THE ENEMY WHENEVER WE APPROACHED SUCH LOCALITIES  THE GUARDS TURNED US BACK ANDSENT US AROUND  ONCE  THE ONLY WAY PAST TWO STRONG POSITIONS OF THECOMRADES WAS THROUGH A BURNT SECTION THAT LAY BETWEEN  FROM EITHER SIDEWE COULD HEAR THE RATTLE AND ROAR OF WAR  WHILE THE AUTOMOBILE PICKEDITS WAY THROUGH SMOKING RUINS AND TOTTERING WALLS  OFTEN THE STREETSWERE BLOCKED BY MOUNTAINS OF DEBRIS THAT COMPELLED US TO GO AROUND  WEWERE IN A LABYRINTH OF RUIN  AND OUR PROGRESS WAS SLOW THE STOCKYARDS  GHETTO  PLANT  AND EVERYTHING  WERE SMOULDERING RUINS FAR OFF TO THE RIGHT A WIDE SMOKE HAZE DIMMED THE SKY   THE TOWN OFPULLMAN  THE SOLDIER CHAUFFEUR TOLD US  OR WHAT HAD BEEN THE TOWN OFPULLMAN  FOR IT WAS UTTERLY DESTROYED  HE HAD DRIVEN THE MACHINE OUTTHERE  WITH DESPATCHES  ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE THIRD DAY  SOME OF THEHEAVIEST FIGHTING HAD OCCURRED THERE  HE SAID  MANY OF THE STREETS BEINGRENDERED IMPASSABLE BY THE HEAPS OF THE DEAD SWINGING AROUND THE SHATTERED WALLS OF A BUILDING  IN THE STOCKYARDSDISTRICT  THE AUTOMOBILE WAS STOPPED BY A WAVE OF DEAD  IT WAS FOR ALLTHE WORLD LIKE A WAVE TOSSED UP BY THE SEA  IT WAS PATENT TO US WHATHAD HAPPENED  AS THE MOB CHARGED PAST THE CORNER  IT HAD BEEN SWEPT  ATRIGHT ANGLES AND POINT BLANK RANGE  BY THE MACHINE GUNS DRAWN UP ON THECROSS STREET  BUT DISASTER HAD COME TO THE SOLDIERS  A CHANCE BOMB MUSTHAVE EXPLODED AMONG THEM  FOR THE MOB  CHECKED UNTIL ITS DEAD AND DYINGFORMED THE WAVE  HAD WHITE CAPPED AND FLUNG FORWARD ITS FOAM OF LIVING FIGHTING SLAVES  SOLDIERS AND SLAVES LAY TOGETHER  TORN AND MANGLED AROUND AND OVER THE WRECKAGE OF THE AUTOMOBILES AND GUNS ERNEST SPRANG OUT  A FAMILIAR PAIR OF SHOULDERS IN A COTTON SHIRT AND AFAMILIAR FRINGE OF WHITE HAIR HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE  I DID NOT WATCH HIM AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS BACK BESIDE ME AND WE WERE SPEEDING ON THATHE SAID  IT WAS BISHOP MOREHOUSE  SOON WE WERE IN THE GREEN COUNTRY  AND I TOOK ONE LAST GLANCE BACK ATTHE SMOKE FILLED SKY  FAINT AND FAR CAME THE LOW THUD OF AN EXPLOSION THEN I TURNED MY FACE AGAINST ERNEST S BREAST AND WEPT SOFTLY FOR THECAUSE THAT WAS LOST  ERNEST S ARM ABOUT ME WAS ELOQUENT WITH LOVE  FOR THIS TIME LOST  DEAR HEART   HE SAID   BUT NOT FOREVER  WE HAVELEARNED  TO MORROW THE CAUSE WILL RISE AGAIN  STRONG WITH WISDOM ANDDISCIPLINE  THE AUTOMOBILE DREW UP AT A RAILROAD STATION  HERE WE WOULD CATCH ATRAIN TO NEW YORK  AS WE WAITED ON THE PLATFORM  THREE TRAINS THUNDEREDPAST  BOUND WEST TO CHICAGO  THEY WERE CROWDED WITH RAGGED  UNSKILLEDLABORERS  PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS  SLAVE LEVIES FOR THE REBUILDING OF CHICAGO   ERNEST SAID   YOU SEE  THECHICAGO SLAVES ARE ALL KILLED  CHAPTER XXVTHE TERRORISTSIT WAS NOT UNTIL ERNEST AND I WERE BACK IN NEW YORK  AND AFTER WEEKS HADELAPSED  THAT WE WERE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THOROUGHLY THE FULL SWEEP OFTHE DISASTER THAT HAD BEFALLEN THE CAUSE  THE SITUATION WAS BITTER ANDBLOODY  IN MANY PLACES  SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY  SLAVE REVOLTS ANDMASSACRES HAD OCCURRED  THE ROLL OF THE MARTYRS INCREASED
